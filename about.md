## Hi, I'm Daryll.

Some of the things I like:

- Reading. Here are the books I have read.
- Programming
- Playing (at this point, just old) video games
- Riding my cool-ass bike
- "Trying" to be a runner
- Hiking up mountains. One of my favorite things to do.
- Studying people and how they live
- Online courses. I have 19.
- "Trying" to cook. I am a recipe cooker.
