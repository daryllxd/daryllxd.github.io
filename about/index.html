<h2 id="web-developer-profile">Web developer profile:</h2>

<p>I am a software developer with 4 years of web development experience. My primary tools include Ruby on Rails, ReactJS via Redux, AWS, PostgreSQL, and Redis, although in the past I have used AngularJS. For now, I am most productive with Ruby and Rails as a back-end language and framework, but I am also looking at Elixir and Go for future projects.</p>

<p>My last job was in <a href="http://www.sourcepad.com/">Sourcepad</a>, where I worked with American clients to get their ideas off the ground. My last three projects were Golfcrow, a golfing app, Xtopia, a data aggregator app, and Commutyble, a parking app. Prior to Sourcepad, I worked for <a href="https://icpa.ph/">I Can Pass Accounting!</a>, an education startup where accounting students can take quizzes for their board exams.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to diversify my interests while maintaining a high knowledge of web development and programming. My <a href="https://github.com/daryllxd/lifelong-learning">lifelong-learning repo</a> (140+ stars) has nearly a hundred thousand lines of lessons from different fields (ex: programming, business, philosophy, cooking). My <a href="https://github.com/daryllxd/daryllxd">daryllxd repo</a> serves as a repository for programming tools I use in my life (productivity tracker, budget tracker).</p>

<p>I live in Manila with my family, and while I am currently open to remote jobs, I am looking for opportunities in Singapore.</p>

<h2 id="random-facts-about-me">Random facts about me:</h2>

<p>Throughout most of my educated life, I was a government scholar in both the highest ranked university and highest ranked high school in my country. Due to a lack of life direction (long story ðŸ˜‚), I dropped out and worked in a call center. This transformative event (which is the best way of saying that I dropped out) paved the way for me to find out what I wanted to do with my life.</p>

<p>I am very much seeking to be an educated generalist (my <a href="https://www.coursera.org/user/9fe1688231eedc03a30f665e59d753e9">Coursera profile</a> lists 26 courses finished). I am very much a lover of learning and I believe in &ldquo;Learn, Create, Ship.&rdquo;, and shipping comes first because we can edit things later anyway.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I go on hikes (more than 30 summits in the Philippines), I go on long bike rides (completed the Audax 200 twice), and I read books.</p>
