## CV:

[Pdf copy here.](http://daryll.codes/cv.pdf)

## Software Development Skills:

- Back-end: Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis.
  - I am able to work at all parts of the Rails stack and I am familiar with most design patterns.
  - I shipped 5 apps when I was at my last company. I have 4 years of software development experience.
  - I also worked as a web developer/designer when I was in college for our startup, [I Can Pass Anything!](https://icpa.ph/). It's the biggest accounting review website in the Philippines, with over 50K+ accounts.
  - I am familiar with most web development features, including, but not limited to: admin panels, connecting to external APIs, scrapers, jobs, notifications, and logging.
  - I can code with or without Rails. I've created [gems to connect to external APIs](https://github.com/sourcepad/synapsis) before.
  - Emphasis on architecture and testing: feel free to look at the back-end of my current project, [Daryllxd](https://github.com/daryllxd/daryllxd), an app I'm writing to help me keep track of my life.
  - While I have not worked on a high-traffic app, I have experience in detecting/lowering page load time for my previous projects.
- Front-end: AngularJS/ReactJS.
  - I have worked in the front-end since JQuery. I've also worked with Angular in one of my previous projects.
  - I'm currently learning React and I'm using it to power one of my self-improvement sites. It's still a work in progress.
- Ops: Amazon Web Services/servers.
  - I have experience in setting up a server from scratch and deploying via Capistrano.
  - I'm currently studying for the AWS Solutions Architect certification exam as a potential benchmark of my skills.
- Other language/framework: Elixir/Phoenix.
  - On the weekends, when I have time, I study Elixir and Phoenix. I'm currently creating [an app](https://github.com/daryllxd/habits_two) to help me keep track of good habits I want to do every day.
- I write about my daily learnings in software development here: [Today I Learned](https://til.daryll.codes).

## Soft Skills:

- High communication and client-facing skills.
  - At my last company, we were in scrums four times a week. I am very comfortable conversing in English.
  - I have spoken at [RubyConf Philippines](http://rubyconf.ph/2018/) and multiple times at the [Philippine Ruby User Group meetups](http://pinoyrb.org/). I blog frequently about my progress at my website, [Daryll Codes](https://daryll.codes).
  - Before I was a developer, I worked at a [call center](https://www.sitel.com/) here in the Philippines. I took up to 40 calls a day as a technical support rep. I created several spiels and email templates to decrease our team's average call time.
- Training/onboarding developers.
  - When I was at my previous company, I taught Ruby/Rails to two of our developers (who were transitioning from other languages). They're still at the company and are now handling client projects.
  - Because I was the senior developer closest to the juniors, I acted as the second line of defense whenever there was a programming problem.

## Culture fit:

- I am very much a lifelong learner, with over 100,000 lines of notes at my [lifelong-learning repo](https://github.com/daryllxd/lifelong-learning). I've also finished 25+ Coursera courses.
- I maintain [a very long reading list](http://daryll.codes/books/). I've read over 50 books in personal development.
- I am a very hardworking individual who isn't afraid to get out of the comfort zone. My hobbies include long-distance cycling (I cycle 200km a week) and hiking (25+ mountains scaled).
