### 1 week before: Preclimb

- Confirm itinerary.
  - When to leave/meeting place, expected costs, options.
  - Get contact details/person to contact in case of emergency for all hikers.
  - Get a contact person in Manila or wherever you are where you can send climb updates to.
  - Required clothing/tools (cold wear, gloves, trekking poles).

- Get hike details.
  - How long is the hike/how many days?
  - Do we expect rain or a hot climb?
  - Are there river crossings involved?
  - Is the trail rocky/do we need to double up on socks?
  - Is there a need to grapple/do rock climbing things?
  - Do you need gloves? The trail might have a lot of prickly plants.
  - Do we expect leeches/limatik?

- Get campsite details.
  - Is it warm enough that you can get by without a sleeping bag/sleeping mat, even if it rains?
  - Is it cold enough that you need a fleece, gloves, doubly-lined socks?
  - Are there  trees/places where you can deploy a hammock, so you don't need to bring a tent?

- Distribution of group equipment:
  - Cookset.
  - Stoves (2-3 for a group of 6). Check what type of fuel (butane/white gas/etc..) they need.
  - Tents.
  - Temporary shelters/tarps. (2-3 for a group of 6, probably less).
  - Ground sheets/mats/places to sit on.
  - Trowel(s).
  - Group first aid kits.
  - Cleaning implements (dish scrubber/tissue paper).
  - Bolo if needed.

### 2-3 days before: get everything you need.

- Confirm you have all the equipment you need.
  - Bag (rain cover, waterproof lining/mother bag), and try packing everything in before the climb just to make sure everything fits.
  - Shelter: tent (body, flysheet, poles, pegs), groundsheet, temporary shelters/tarps (tying strings, pegs).
  - Insulation: sleeping bag, sleeping mat, malong.
  - Navigation: emergency whistle/compass, rope. Fortunately I've only had to use the whistle once, but being lost is really disconcerting.
  - First aid kit: personal medicine, triangular bandage, elastic bandage, insect repellent.
  - Camp water: Water containers when camping. If the campsite has a water source, you probably don't have to fill this up.
  - Trail water: Hydration pack/water bottles while climbing. Possibly need energy drinks if the hike is long?
  - Things for cooking: cookset, stove, stove wind screen, enough fuel, fire-starter/lighter/waterproof matches, folding knife, ladle, chopping board.
  - Things for eating: mess kit/plate/cup, spork or spoon and fork, chopsticks.
  - Toiletries: Tissue paper, toothbrush/toothpaste, sunscreen/sun protection, comb, alcohol, deodorant, petroleum jelly for chafing, etc.
  - Light: Headlamp with extra batteries. Make sure those batteries fit.
  - Number 2: Trowel.
  - Repair: Sewing kit, tent repair kit, duct tape.
  - Dog tag.
  - Money!
- Check that you have your hiking costumes ready:
  - For hiking: cap/visor/brimmed hat, sunglasses (optional), dry fit shirt/polo, rash guards (optional), gloves (optional), shorts/leggings, technical socks (2 layers if you need), trail runners/boots (check if they might break down during the climb). [Reference](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/how-to-choose-hiking-clothes.html)
  - For camping: bonnet/[Ushanka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ushanka), [face mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_mask), [base layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layered_clothing), fleece/mid layer (optional), gloves (optional), windbreaker, thermal underwear, wool socks, sandals for walking around the camp/resting your feet after the climb. I wouldn't recommend cotton jackets because if it gets wet, it's unusable. [Reference](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/layering-basics.html)
  - For going home: cute outfit.
- Review your meal assignments.
  - 1 kg of rice per meal? (Not sure of the ratio.)
  - For us what works is 0.8kg of protein for 4 people per meal.
  - Soupy foods are also nice if you're assigned to cooking at the campsite.
  - Precook (boil your meats, then put some vinegar before freezing).
  - Blanch your vegetables.
  - I prefer pasta if I know there's a water source near the camp site. It's easier to cook than rice.
- Trail food.
  - High in carbohydrate üç´, my favorite is Nips/Jelly Ace.
- [Carb loading.](https://github.com/daryllxd/lifelong-learning/blob/master/fitness/carbo-loading/articles.md)
- Treats: Iced tea, coffee ‚òïÔ∏è, chocolates/stuff you can melt to make a fondue, anything that can justify its weight.

### The morning (or evening) of the climb

- This is my alarm clock: [Kukuklok.](http://www.kukuklok.com/)
- Confirm weather, confirm that you have everything you need.
- I like bringing a [Sleep mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindfold) because I find it hard to sleep anyways.
- Scan room before leaving, also make sure you put your pre-cooked stuff inside your bag (they might be in the fridge).
- Enjoy! üòÑ
