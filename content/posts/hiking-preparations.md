### 1 week before: Pre-climb/itineraries. üèî

- Confirm itinerary.
  - When to leave/meeting place, expected costs, options re: going to the jump-off point.
  - Required permits for the climb.
  - Confirm assignments: who's the team leader, assistant leader/sweeper, medic.

  - Are there river crossings involved?
  - Is the trail rocky/do we need to double up on socks?
  - Is there a need to grapple/rappel/do rock climbing things?
  - Do you need gloves? The trail might have a lot of prickly plants.
  - Do we expect leeches/limatik? If so bring sprayable alcohol. [Dealing with Leeches.](http://www.pinoymountaineer.com/2008/01/limatik-blood-leeches-overview.html)

- [Get campsite details](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/campsite-selection.html).

### 2-3 days before: get everything you need for the climb.  üèî

Reading list: [The Ten Essentials](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/ten-essentials.html), [Backpacking Checklist] (https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/backpacking-checklist.html).

- Confirm you have all the equipment you need.
  - **[Bag.](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/backpack.html)** Try packing everything in before the climb just to make sure everything fits. Rain cover, waterproof lining/mother bag.
  - **Shelter.** [Tent](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/backpacking-tent.html) (body, flysheet, poles, pegs), groundsheet, [temporary shelters/tarps (tying strings, pegs)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W76LyJdNYU).
  - **Insulation.** [Sleeping bag](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/sleeping-bag-backpacking.html), [sleeping mat](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/sleeping-pads.html), [malong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malong).
  - **Illumination.** Headlamp with extra batteries. Make sure those batteries fit.
  - **Navigation.** Emergency whistle/compass, rope. Fortunately I've only had to use the whistle once, but being lost is really disconcerting.
  - **First aid kit.** Personal medicine, triangular bandage, elastic bandage, insect repellent.
  - **Camp hydration.** Water containers when camping. If the campsite has a water source, you probably don't have to fill this up.
  - **Trail hydration.** Hydration pack/water bottles while climbing. [Sports drinks](https://www.mensfitness.com/nutrition/what-to-drink/sports-drinks-vs-water).
  - **Cooking.** Cookset, stove, stove wind screen, enough fuel, fire-starter/lighter/waterproof matches, folding knife, ladle, chopping board.
  - **Nutrition.** Mess kit/plate/cup, spork or spoon and fork, chopsticks.
  - **Emergency food.** Peanut butter has a high energy to weight ratio, though canned goods like canned tuna can also work.
  - **Toiletries, sun protection.** Tissue paper, toothbrush/toothpaste, sunscreen/lip balm, comb, alcohol, deodorant, petroleum jelly for chafing, etc.
  - **Number 2/poopsies.** Trowel.
  - **Repair.** Sewing kit, tent repair kit, duct tape.
  - **Water treatment.** Water filter.
  - **Identification.** Dog tag.
  - Money!
- Check that you have your costumes ready:
  - **For hiking.** Cap/visor/brimmed hat, sunglasses (optional), dry fit shirt/polo, rash guards (optional), gloves (optional), shorts/leggings, technical socks (2 layers if you need), trail runners/boots (check if they might break down during the climb). [Reference](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/how-to-choose-hiking-clothes.html)
  - **For camping.** Bonnet/[Ushanka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ushanka), [face mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_mask), [base layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layered_clothing), fleece/mid layer (optional), gloves (optional), windbreaker, thermal underwear, wool socks, sandals for walking around the camp/resting your feet after the climb. I wouldn't recommend cotton jackets because if it gets wet, it's unusable. [Layering basics.](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/layering-basics.html)
  - For going home: cute outfit.
- Review your meal assignments.
  - How many people do you need to cook for?
  - Roughly 0.5 cups of raw rice per 2 people per meal. [How much rice should I cook per person?](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/23880/how-much-rice-should-i-cook-per-person)
  - Roughly 0.8kg of protein/meat for 4 people per meal.
  - Soupy foods are also nice if you're assigned to cooking at the campsite.
  - Precook (boil your meats, then put some vinegar before freezing).
  - Blanch your vegetables.
  - I prefer pasta if I know there's a water source near the camp site. It's easier to cook than rice.
- Trail food.
  - High in carbohydrates üç´, my favorite is Nips/Jelly Ace.
- [Carb loading.](https://github.com/daryllxd/lifelong-learning/blob/master/fitness/carbo-loading/articles.md)
- Treats: Iced tea, coffee ‚òïÔ∏è, chocolates/stuff you can melt to make a fondue, anything that can justify its weight.
- Review skills:
  - Knot tying. Taut line/clove hitch/sheet bend/2 half hitches/slip knot.
  - Pitch your tent just to make sure there aren't holes etc.
  - Navigation.

### The morning (or evening) of the climb: final preparations. üèî

- This is my alarm clock: [Kukuklok.](http://www.kukuklok.com/)
- Double check the weather and confirm that you haven't forgotten anything. Scan room before leaving, also make sure you put your pre-cooked stuff inside your bag (they might still be in the fridge).
- I like bringing a [Sleep mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindfold) because I find it hard to sleep anyways.
- Check with your team leaders first if the climb will push through before you go to the bus station. üòÖ
- Enjoy! üòÑ


### TODO: (for me)

- Hiking apps.
- Actual checklist.
