Like a craftsman has a set of their favorite tools, here are mine:

### Software

- Text editor: Vim. I practically live in this.
- Shell: zsh.
- Version control: Git.
- Searcher: The Silver Searcher.
- Screen capturing: Kapture.io.
- OS X navigator: Alfred.
- File synchronization: Dropbox.
- Time tracker: Daryllxd.
- Todo list manager: Todoist but I'm starting to hate it.
- Social media blocker: Freedom.to.
- Youtube downloader: `youtube-dl`.
- Spotify playing: `shpotify`.
- Chrome Extensions:
  - Marinara Pomodoro timer.
  - Kill News Feed.
  - Font selector.
  - Ad blocker.
  - JSON viewer.
- Note taking: Vim.
- Keyboard rebinding: Karabiner-Elements.
  - Rebind Caps Lock to Escape.
  - Rebind h, j, k, and l to up, left, down, up, and right respectively.

### Hardware

- Laptop: Company-issued 2015 Macbook Pro (no touch bar).
- Keyboard: Leopold mechanical keyboard with Cherry blue switches.
- Mouse: G400S.
- Mousepad: Razer Goliathus full-length mousepad.
- Secondary monitor: Samsung 24". I want a bigger one.
- Headphones: Bose Quietcomfort 35. This is a game changer.

### The dream:

- A maxed-out Macbook Pro for work.
- A maxed-out iPad Pro or whatever Android tablet for dilly-dallying and for practicing doodles.
- An adjustable standing/sitting desk.
