You'll meet several thousands of people in your life, and they have their own viewpoints and stories and whatever, and you'll disagree with them a fair amount of times given a life time, but you should always remembers one thing: they're not always wrong, and you're not always right.

You have to fight the innate human instinct to short-circuit decision making which incentivizes making a snap judgment on an idea based on its messenger. Well, I guess you can do the short-circuiting thing if it's just a small thing, but for big life decisions, you cannot be that fickle. Remember that growth and idea is what matters, not your personal biases.

As someone living in a poor country who (someday) wants to immigrate to a better life in a richer country, in order to contribute to the bleeding edge of humanity, I don't agree with Trump and his immigration policies. But to disregard everything he says or everything he does is naive: I can take a lesson from "how to get better at public speaking", "how to be convince others with your arguments", and read parts of his life and take what I can to improve my life.

People have several ingredients to their personality: How would you feel if your entire being was invalidated based on one idea that you had? There was one person I particularly didn't like, but was a good cook, so I just got good cooking tips from her anyway. And while I don't agree with her beliefs, I thank her for those cooking tips.

This is something that I have to practice more, but at least I know that it exists. I'll consolidate this idea/blog posts as I discover new things."
