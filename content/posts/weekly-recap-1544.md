On the 1544rd week of my life, I:

- Read: [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095)
- Listened to: [Naval Ravikant: The Angel Philosopher on Investing, Making Decisions, Happiness and the Meaning of Life](https://fs.blog/naval-ravikant/)
- Fasted: 50 hours. Yeah!

**Note: This is me backfilling posts from the weekly series. I had not been keeping up to date, well where it is!**

I'm currently reading up a ton on how being a foreign worker in Singapore is like. From my understanding, it will take 2-3 weeks for Singapore's Ministry of Manpower to come up with results for a work pass. Well, I'm 99% sure I'll get it because I don't have a criminal record anyway, but it's crazy how insidious the 1% of my brain is telling me that "no you will get rejected". While preparing for the worst of a process is good, if it's not constructive, then what's the use?

I'm also thinking about what kind of place I'll move in to. I honestly have very few requirements: I just need a place that is quiet enough that I can think and code and enough space for me to have a bike, have a bike trainer, and allow me to bike indoors. That's basically it. So I have to think about roommates because the rent in Singapore is damn expensive.

On the 24th, my brother Jerico came over and we played Settlers of Catan (my dad, my 2 brothers, and I). It's so weird to me that this is happening since we haven't done social things in a long time. I feel like we've always been studying and silo-ed in our own little worlds and computers that having an offline bonding experience is really worth it.

- 50 hour fast! I just vaguely remember this but I do remember the part that near the end, I rode my bike for like 20 minutes. I felt like dying lol.
- My UE friends and I ate at a buffet in Cubao. It was my last buffet in the Philippines.
