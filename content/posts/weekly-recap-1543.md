# Hello TradeGecko

Okay I'm really hoping that this is going to push through (I'm writing this on June 24, because I crammed this part hehe) but I'm at a 99.9% certainty already, so. I've accepted a new job offer at [TradeGecko Singapore](https://www.tradegecko.com/) as a senior developer. Yeah... It's so weird to say this because when I graduated back in 2014, I was just dreaming of being a senior developer, and now it's officially here. Really proud of myself. I busted my ass, put in thousands of hours of study and work, had the trials and tribulations, felt good, felt bad, but yeah I've sort of made it at least on an international level.

If any future officemates read this, hello guys, thank you for trusting me. I'll do my best :)

# Positive Social Media

- Posted for the first time in x months asking for Singapore things.
  - People from all parts of my life had things to say.
  - Really grateful for this

# Musings

- Ever since I was young, I've been competitive in everything that I did, but now that I'm growing older, I can't recall any successful person that isn't competitive. This doesn't necessarily mean being competitive with others. I think being competitive with your best version of yourself is extremely important.
  - Sourcepad: In a company-wide hackathon, a day where literally nothing is done except code a cool prototype of company-beneficial software, people JUST WENT HARD. In my last Sourcepad hackathon, we (Nikki, Virna, Rav, and Erik) meta-gamed the hell out of the criteria - good design/good screens, a skit when we presented the app, some "machine learning" that sort of worked, an answer to basically every question that was going to get asked. We won :)


Bringing an A-Game, Competition

All good employees/high performers are usually competitive AF.

- Everything in life ties up. How I react to other people outside of the workplace, my personality type, what I do, what I read, what I like, who I interact with, what I'm paid for, how I view the world. So it's in my best interest to understand everything I can so I can operate with more complete information so I can make better decisions to push things in the decision that I want.
- This is why biking is important, hiking is important, chatting with good friends are important, being around good friends are important.
- You have one brain and one body. You have to train that body and that brain to be the best it can possibly be.


It's like my job is to assimilate those ideas and crystallize them into something that adds value to the world.
