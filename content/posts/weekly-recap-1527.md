  - Habits One, Elixir project. I have authentication and authorization working now, as well as the basic CRUD functionality.
  - Consulting: I worked with my homies re: consulting on an all-around inventory/payroll system.
  - I spoke with programmers more this week. With my friends, I spoke with them on how I'd be able to get high salary in my new job. As I suspected, it's about skills. Okay. [I just need more skills.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsiiIa6bs9I)
  - Tool adjustment: I create a Spotify playlist of Deadmau5 songs. These get me super pumped to code shit.
  - Tool musing: At some point I need to know Docker, if only to optimize my working processes with my future team.

## Life updates

My main objective for this week was to learn the [Elixir programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir_(programming_language)) and make something productive with it. All the cool Rails developers seem to be migrating to Elixir. Plus, I haven't learned a language in three years.

I'm enjoying it. It's easier to learn a programming language if you know others already. I can draw upon my Ruby and Rails experience to help me learn Elixir and Phoenix. Much of the first few days has been "how do I implement `<insert Ruby command>` in `<insert Elixir command>`. I know that this limits my development to "Elixir language features that are also implemented in Ruby", but for now, it's okay. I'll get to the Elixir-specific features later.

My app for Elixir is Habits One, a habit tracking app. A user can put in their habit, then every day they can manually flag if they do the habit or not. That's the core of the app. I'll show a screenshot when I have a prototype up.

My tactics on learning Elixir:

- I learn fastest by reading a book, so I got a copy of both Programming Elixir and Programming Phoenix. Since my goal is to create an application, I also needed to learn the Phoenix web framework.
- Write my sample project. I hate writing code that I won't use. I really wanted to make a habits tracking app anyway, so I might as well do it in the language I want to learn. Elixir also has a language feature which makes it easier to send notifications/updates to users. I imagine that this would be very important in the app that I'm making.
- I spent a few hours working on mechanics via [Elixir Koans.](https://github.com/elixirkoans/elixir-koans). Koans are a set of exercises designed to burn language features in your brain. It's like flashcards for developers. It's a way for me to be more familiar and comfortable with the language.
- Reading other projects. Reading how code is structured. Looking at a sample project so I can have a basis on how things work and I can do the code comparison thing when I have a bug. [This is the project I'm basing my work on.](https://github.com/gothinkster/elixir-phoenix-realworld-example-app)
- After each day, I write TILs (Today I learned). That way I can marinate the ideas in my head.
- Try not to get sidetracked. This is my problem: I keep on getting sidetracked by reading documentation and blog articles. I get to know some other features of the language, but I fall in a rabbit hole and I still haven't finished the book!
- Just grind it out. I don't care if other people are faster than me or are better than me. For example, there's a chapter in the book about concurrency. I don't really understand everything at first pass but I know I can get back to it later. Or I can browse a screencast, or muck around and try to make my own.

Okay, see you. I need to write my speech!
