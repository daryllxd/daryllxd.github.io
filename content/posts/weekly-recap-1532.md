- Biked: 176 km.
- Coding:
  - First React app, [Writing Prompts](https://writing.daryll.codes), which is just a micro-site of getting a writing prompt for the day, my motivations, potentially a feedback form, and an About me page.
  - Improving the caching implementation for Daryllxd, but at this point, I've probably put in more effort than I should, but I can use this in the future.
  - Mini-concepts that I read deeply about:
    - How blockchain works and what it means to be a blockchain developer.
    - Open source code: [`redis-namespace`](https://github.com/resque/redis-namespace) code in the hopes of deeply analyzing how things work.
  - Getting started with Chef and provisioning servers for my future plans!

## Tidbits:

- I think I'm reaching the tipping point on my JavaScript adventure in 2018: actually getting to deploy apps with React and Github pages is really cool. I've already created my first app and I want to create a lot more. I see microsites and micro-blogs as a possible startup idea generator, plus it's so damn cool to work on something that can potentially help other people. I know that I'll use some incarnation of Writing Prompts as I keep on fleshing it out.
- With that said, I have to replicate that experience with the back-end, and I think that Chef is a step in the correct direction. While I like the idea of Docker and container orchestration, I'm a patient guy. I want to learn this because I know that this will be helpful in the long term.
- Got to play Catan with my dad and brother a few times this week. Catan is a brilliant example of the Art of War: you don't want to win too much, because everyone gangs up on you. I won twice, using deceptive strategies and appearing weak when I was actually strong.
- Felt some depression over the weekend, but I was ready this time. A good old fashioned walk around the neighborhood and a chat with friends and family and I was okay the next day. Historically, this pattern should repeat, but I'm hoping to get better at coping with this.
