I've decided to start blogging again. And this time I want to stick to this for good (like for the rest of my life). A few years back I did the Project 365 thing where you took a picture of the day for 365 days. I really liked that year since I actively tried to do something per day so surely writing about things should have that kind of effect ðŸ˜±

A few rules for now:

- I must do a blog post every week. No matter how crappy I feel about that week. It could be something generic like "this is what I did". But I must do a blog post because I want to get better as a writer.
- 500 word limit per post. I think an arbitrary limit is good, that way I have this "sense of completion" thing going. Yeah, word length is probably not a good metric, but whatever.
- I have to enjoy what I read. If someone else reads it and gets something out of it, then cool. But it must be of use to me at least.

In this blog, expect to see:

- Musings about life. I write things in my journal every day. The things that really stand out get a blog post. Hehe.
- My journey of self-improvement. I think this is the main theme of 2017 for me. In 2016 I spent a majority of my free time riding the bike and playing Dota, in 2015 I spent it going up mountains. In 2017 I'm planning to be more proactive with the skill-gaining process. So far, I've learned how to cook, how to take care of our house, how to take care of my face, conversation with other people, some photography basics, and now some writing basics. I want to acquire more skills moving forward.
- My projects/life's work. I'm going to turn 30 soon and while I like what I have done so far re: work projects and completing my general bucket list, but I still don't have that much in terms of a physical body of work to show to my kids some day. I'm thinking apps, photos, memoirs/essays, physical artifacts, whatever. I like listening to my parents' stories about their adventures when they were young, but they don't really have many photos of their travels. I think it would be awesome for my descendants to see my crazy-ass adventures. I might even print this blog in the future.

It's funny because it took a long time for me to write a draft of this post, then I just scrapped everything and I'm like fuck it, whatever. Learn, create, ship. :)
