TL, DR:

1. Only own the things you really need.

Here are all my things in the world:

![pic alt](path "opt title")

something about people saving items because of the war. but you arent really saving if you arent using it

I have, as of, 150 things. SO I keep on reading about minimalism and how .

Clothes:

Programming related stuff:

Bike-related stuff:

Camping-related stuff:

Photography related stuff:

What's not on here: my crappy car. I have a 1997 Honda Civic. I use it probably once a month. It will get me and my homies to Tagaytay, but probably not that much further. It's impossible to drive around Manila anyway.

I don't pay car payments every month because it's already paid off since it's so cheap. The philosophy behind it is that I rarely use a car anyways but when I need it, I really need it. So yeah.

Here are the benefits:


1. I save a lot.  Less expenses means more money to buy books and go on trips.
2. Nearly every thing I have is my favorite thing. :)
3. Lower maintenance costs. I don't have much decision fatigue on when I'm looking for something.
4. I rarely have regrets when I buy things.
5. It's easy for me to pack and travel because I have an idea on where everything is.


On when to get rid of something:

- I have to be ruthless with things. It's hard to throw away shirts especially if they have . But honestly, if you haven't really worn them in the last 6 months, you probably weren't going to wear them anyway. I prefer to think about it as "All of my shirts are my favorite shirts."

How to begin:

Just look inside your closet and throw out the clothes that you really haven't worn in a while now.
