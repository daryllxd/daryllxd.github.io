**Summary:**

1. I have 103 things. Having few, high quality things has made my life easier because I don't have to think that much.
2. The point of the challenge is not having a limit, but limiting consumption.
3. Impulse buys are the worst. Whenever you want to buy something, don't think you'll miss out if you don't buy it. Just wait for a few days before actually buying the thing.

I first heard about the 100 Things Challenge when I was a college student. I've been following it for a few years. At first it was easy to do since I didn't really buy things when I was a student, but when I started working, it became harder to maintain, especially with stylish co-workers with their 10+ pairs of shoes and their never-repeating clothes. I've cut back on my spending though, and here are all my things in the world:

## Musings

For most things, I prefer the higher quality versions. The problem with cheap stuff is that they break down so easily, and you regret buying them. I've had most of my camping stuff intact for the past two years since they never broke down anyway. My cookset's been with me for the past 5 years.

Clothes are the big thing. At first you'll feel weird wearing close to the same clothes every day, but you'll realize that people don't care. I don't have shirts that I don't like wearing. So, every shirt is my favorite shirt. Making decisions on what to wear is easy especially because I have the same color scheme anyway (black, olive green, maroon, navy blue, dark grey). Just pick the clothes at the top of your drawer and don't pick pants that are the same color. Then add stylish shoes and you're good to go!

If you're trying a hobby out, you can start with the cheaper things first. I used to have a folding bike when I was just learning how to ride it. I rode that bike until it broke down and was unrepairable. Seeing as there were multiple benefits in biking to work, I decided to upgrade to a faster and lighter road bike.

That bike is the most expensive non-programming thing on that list, and it has more than paid for itself with the amount of money and time it saves.

The point of being minimalist is intentionality. Just have the things you need. 100 is literally a number. I don't really care about violating the rule because I've used every single thing in that list in the past months. (Well, everything except the hammock.)

To start, just start segregating your stuff. Be really ruthless on if you need those things or not. I've actually just started segregating things again-I've bought some stupid crap lately, and it turns out that I still had too many shirts.

I'll continue this article next time. But I have to ship! :)
