        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Today, I rode a climb up Tagaytay, Sungay In the Philippines. It&rsquo;s an inhuman climb, with gradients at 15% in the straighter sections and up to 25% in the corners. It&rsquo;s a climb that is difficult to walk on, never mind riding a bike though.
It&rsquo;s often at the edge of our ability that every thing we put in matters. While I&rsquo;ve been religiously training on the bike for the past few months, and I&rsquo;ve been using a road bike for two years, the Sungay climb&rsquo;s ridiculous gradients exposed me.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            There are days where I can say that I&rsquo;m really not that motivated that much. It could be something with my brain or with my sleep or with my food or with my exercise, but I don&rsquo;t want anyone reading this blog to have this illusion that I don&rsquo;t have bad days. I&rsquo;ve had a lot of shitty days.
When those days come along, I ask myself, what is the smallest unit of work that I can do to move me closer to my dreams?

        <p>
            You choose the suffering you want to experience. &ldquo;Suffer the pain of discipline or suffer the pain of regret.&rdquo;
As I struggle (and groan at the words that I&rsquo;m typing) to think and push through with this article, I know that at any time, I can just switch to a new tab and continue mindlessly browsing Twitter and Hacker News.
The problem with doing that is that I know that I&rsquo;ll hate myself in the morning when the feeling of having skipped a day clouds over me, and I&rsquo;d rather just kludge through writing this post even if I&rsquo;m really sleepy and tired.

        <p>
            This title is very apt since I&rsquo;m really tired right now (the bike just killed me), but here goes.
You brain has a limited amount of willpower and decisions it can do per day. Don&rsquo;t waste this on stupid shit by creating systems that will incentivize good habits while disallowing bad ones.
Food system: there&rsquo;s no way for my brother and I to eat bad food in the house because we only buy nutritious food.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            A huge life goal of mine is to create a body of work that I can ultimately look back on and be proud of. I&rsquo;m hoping to build some software that helps a lot of people, or write a blog post that gets someone to take control of their life, or possibly speak at a conference and inspire someone to build their own empire.
If that is to be a reality, then I&rsquo;ll have to put in a certain number of repetitive deliberate practice.

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">30 Days of Writing, Day 3: Always try to do things faster.</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Always ask yourself: is there an easier, faster, and better way of doing things?
If there is, then follow up by asking, would the time spent learning that way save time in the long-term?
I first came into contact with the text editor I use for writing my programs (Vim) 4 years ago, and while it was a nightmare to learn I knew that if I just buckled down and forced myself to learn it for the next 20-100 hours, it would pay off at some point.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            In my junior and senior years in college, I had absolutely nothing going for me (horrible grades, very few friends, and no money) that I based my self-worth off my greatest &ldquo;strength&rdquo; at the time, which was video games and Magic: The Gathering.
A really low point was when I was trying to construct a resume to look for a call center job after I had been expelled from my collegeâ€”asides from the schools I attended, I couldn&rsquo;t write anything.

        <p>
            There&rsquo;s something seriously wrong with how I interpret myself as an aspiring writer. For someone who has the audacity to call himself that, I haven&rsquo;t been doing a lot of writing.
My long-standing alibi has been &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write the horribleness out of my system by just writing a lot of articles&rdquo;, but I seem to always conveniently forget what &ldquo;a lot&rdquo; means, especially when it comes to hitting &ldquo;commit&rdquo; on my computer.
