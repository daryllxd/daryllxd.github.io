<h2 id="creating-bike-paps">Creating Bike Paps</h2>

<p>Now that I have my first ReactJS project under my belt <a href="https://writing.daryll.codes">(Writing Prompts!)</a>, I&rsquo;m going to make something a little more complex. It should, at some point, have Redux, HTTP stuff (Axios or fetch), Google Maps integration, possibly user accounts, and other advanced React/modern front-end features. I&rsquo;m excited. I think there is a niche for this because there are very few cycling resources in the Philippines. (There could even be a react-native app in the future, who knows?)</p>

<h2 id="one-ten-sentence-article-per-day-for-april">One Ten-Sentence Article Per Day for April</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided that I was really just fooling myself with the writing thing because I wasn&rsquo;t constantly shipping. It&rsquo;s probably too much of a reach for me that I decided that I&rsquo;ll have to ship an article per day, just like what Seth Godin, Casey Neistat, and Gary Vaynerchuk does.</p>

<p>Still not confident in sharing it with the rest of the world, but make no mistake, by the end of April, I will rewrite these 30 ideas into 30 blog posts and share it out. My idea is that I&rsquo;ll spend 30 days and 30 articles getting better at creating these.</p>

<p>Those articles are scoped to exactly ten (an arbitrary number of) sentences each. I got this from Chase Jarvis, I think, where he said that it&rsquo;s easier to design things if there&rsquo;s a constraint to them. I completely agree: ten sentences is just short enough that I don&rsquo;t get anxious starting, while long enough that an article gets substance.</p>

<ul>
<li>Got some job interviews coming in, but they&rsquo;re all local. I have a slight anxiety when passing CVs to foreign companies, which is really stupid because that&rsquo;s literally the step I have to do, right?</li>
<li>Really immersing myself on serverless technology. I&rsquo;llkkkkkk</li>
<li>Granularizing some common steps when making web applications.</li>
</ul>
