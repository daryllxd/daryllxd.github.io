<li>I added a <code>started_at</code> and <code>ended_at</code> to the table. This is huge. The goal of the eternal side project is to keep me productive, and I&rsquo;ve noticed that I can get carried away doing frivolous things from time to time. With a <code>started_at</code> and <code>ended_at</code>, I can literally see what time in the day I was unproductive.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been implementing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern">Composite pattern</a> for <code>Payloads</code>/<code>Errors</code> in <code>SuccessfulOperation</code>. It really fits the needs of &ldquo;I want to return this operation, but I also want to be able to add attachments or errors if I need to.&rdquo; I also want tor return <code>NullPayload</code> and <code>NullErrors</code>.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Coding. Transcripto:

<ul>
<li>While I like what Bulma does, I changed it back to Bootstrap. There&rsquo;s a high chance that when I get to another company, they use Bootstrap anyway. Plus I need to concentrate on shipping rather than creating weird stuff.</li>
<li>Currently doing UI work. I think this thing is going to work conceptually because it will save people a lot of time. It also publicizes the speaker&rsquo;s work. Maybe. I&rsquo;m not really sure. I just have to finish this so I can have a portfolio project of my own that&rsquo;s web-based.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m thinking of just buying a Bootstrap theme just so things look slicker. Let&rsquo;s see.</li>

<h2 id="life-updates">Life updates:</h2>

<p>I like the direction things are headed so far. I&rsquo;ve been slowly adding helpful habits while deleting bad ones.</p>

<p>When I wake up, I weigh myself. This makes me keep grounded even if eat bad things because I know I&rsquo;ll have to weigh and check myself later.</p>

<p>I constantly write down things on my journal. It&rsquo;s so funny because I checked my journal entries from a few months back and I was laughing at how inane some of the entries were. There&rsquo;s something there about &ldquo;Why Beaches Suck&rdquo;. First point: &ldquo;No Internet.&rdquo; Lol.</p>

<p>My mind has been blown by the concentration articles on the Art of Manliness blog, so much so that I&rsquo;m constantly doing things now just to keep my concentration in place. I just start a Pomodoro and simply concentrate on the task at hand without interruptions. It takes a lot of energy and willpower but usually, after the time is up, I&rsquo;m blown away by how much I got done.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to ask more questions lately. I&rsquo;m trying to start a Hacker News or Reddit thread every day about something that interests me. It&rsquo;s been really good so far. Google usually answers questions of a &ldquo;what&rdquo; variety. For the &ldquo;how&rdquo;, I&rsquo;ll just ask a person.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s so weird to see my name at <a href="http://rubyconf.ph/2018/">Rubyconf</a>. This is my first time speaking at a programming conference. I&rsquo;m pumped. I read somewhere that &ldquo;Just try not to suck, because people don&rsquo;t remember talks anyway&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll be presenting on some of the good habits I&rsquo;ve built up over the years. I&rsquo;ve been working on it intermittently for the last month, but I have to dedicate a chunk of time rehearsing the entire speech. The last time I gave a talk at the local Ruby users group meetup, it was too damn long. Like freaking 20 minutes over the time limit. Huhu bells.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to put all the &ldquo;Learning How To Learn&rdquo; lessons I took when I start drilling down on Elixir next week. It&rsquo;s about time, because I keep on reading about it in a book but not really create a project with it. I have to immerse myself in the language by not doing anything except that language. So yeah, I&rsquo;m excited. Daryllxd becomes a multi-language back-end.</p>

<p>Okay, see you. I have to ride my bike!</p>
