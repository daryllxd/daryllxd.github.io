<p>I&rsquo;m writing this recap more than a week after the fact, but whatever. On this week, I met and pair-programmed with Ramon, Ace, and AJ of Bloom Solutions. This was the first time I pair-programmed in a long time, and also the first time I pair-programmed for an entire day. I love pair programming, because I honestly think it brings out the best in both of you.</p>

<p>So in coding, there are a lot of heuristics to measure one&rsquo;s coding styles, but on a specific dimension (planning vs doing), there are two extremes: super doers (spray-and-pray/cowboy coders) and super planners (must get everything right first before writing a line of code). I have a tendency to lean towards being a planner: I&rsquo;ve tried Rambo coding before and oftentimes I regret it at the end when I have to refactor. While this leans towards me making a more robust/structured systems architecture, it comes at the risk of over-analyzing and inaction. With pair programming, because we have to move on, we can make a quick consensus on the scope of the problem that&rsquo;s happening and implement a solution.</p>

<p>I loved Bloom&rsquo;s application process, much more than other companies&rsquo; processes because it&rsquo;s practical and it makes sense. I&rsquo;ve reviewed and sat in on interviews when I was at Sourcepad and it was so hard to evaluate coding talent in a short time frame. So there&rsquo;s two types of output in software development: the actual code, and the thought process behind the code. You can check actual code on Github, but it&rsquo;s hard to figure out someone&rsquo;s thought process in a one hour interview. At least when you spend a day with the person, solving a problem, asking things, explaining things, giving and receiving feedback, you sort of get to know them both as a coder and as a person.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ll add to this post in the future. But I really do hope that software companies participate more in whole day pair programming sessions. If it&rsquo;s a cost thing, then you really should participate because if you misjudge talent, then it will cost you more. Toodles!</p>
