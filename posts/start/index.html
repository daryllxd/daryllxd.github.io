		<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to start blogging again. And this time I want to stick to this for good (like for the rest of my life). A few years back I did the Project 365 thing where you took a picture of the day for 365 days. I really liked that year since I actively tried to do something per day so surely writing about things should have that kind of effect ðŸ˜±</p>

<p>A few rules for now:</p>

<ul>
<li>I must do a blog post every week. No matter how crappy I feel about that week. It could be something generic like &ldquo;this is what I did&rdquo;. But I must do a blog post because I want to get better as a writer.</li>
<li>500 word limit per post. I think an arbitrary limit is good, that way I have this &ldquo;sense of completion&rdquo; thing going. Yeah, word length is probably not a good metric, but whatever.</li>
<li>I have to enjoy what I read. If someone else reads it and gets something out of it, then cool. But it must be of use to me at least.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this blog, expect to see:</p>

<ul>
<li>Musings about life. I write things in my journal every day. The things that really stand out get a blog post. Hehe.</li>
<li>My journey of self-improvement. I think this is the main theme of 2017 for me. In 2016 I spent a majority of my free time riding the bike and playing Dota, in 2015 I spent it going up mountains. In 2017 I&rsquo;m planning to be more proactive with the skill-gaining process. So far, I&rsquo;ve learned how to cook, how to take care of our house, how to take care of my face, how to have better conversations, how to do basic photography, and now I&rsquo;m learning how to write nice things, lol. I want to acquire more skills moving forward.</li>
<li>My projects/life&rsquo;s work. I&rsquo;m going to turn 30 soon and while I like what I have done so far re: work projects and completing my general bucket list, but I still don&rsquo;t have that much in terms of a physical body of work to show to my kids some day. I&rsquo;m thinking apps, photos, memoirs/essays, physical artifacts, whatever. I like listening to my parents&rsquo; stories about their adventures when they were young, but they don&rsquo;t really have many photos of their travels. I think it would be awesome for my descendants to see my crazy-ass adventures. I might even print this blog in the future.</li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny because it took a long time for me to write a draft of this post, then I just scrapped everything and I&rsquo;m like fuck it, whatever. Learn, create, ship. :)</p>
