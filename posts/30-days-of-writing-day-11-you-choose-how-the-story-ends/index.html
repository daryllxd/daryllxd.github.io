		<p>The story doesn&rsquo;t end until you choose for it to end. I learned this story the hard way when I was still trying to develop my mind and my mental toughness.</p>

<p>In order for me to become a UP mountaineer, I needed to run 15 kilometers in 1 hour and 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Because of my lack of preparation, both physically and mentally, I struggled mightily, and at one point, I yelled out in frustration to my friends who were helping me, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how I feel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt really bad afterwards-not only did I let down those good people and myself, but I did it in an embarrassing fashion: by being a selfish and entitled asshole.</p>

<p>The very next day, I told myself, &ldquo;This is not going to be the story of how I was being undisciplined in my exercise and ungrateful to the people who were trying to help me; this is the story of how I overcome a failure and work through it to become a UPM member.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus began the next chapter of that story: I forced myself to learn how to bike to get some regular cardio, I forced myself to get tougher mentally by using that bike every day (even when it was raining, and even when it was hot), and I went on hikes with people I didn&rsquo;t know so I&rsquo;d be forced to get better in actual hiking and pacing myself.</p>

<p>Since that qualifying 15km run, I&rsquo;ve experienced nearly every possible catastrophe in my athletic pursuits: crashes, bonking, extreme heat, leg cramps, ass cramps, sore shoulders on the bike, busted knees, and being physically unable to walk due to sheer exhaustion, but I&rsquo;m proud of those, because those meant that it was my body that failed, and not my mind (oh and I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to finish all the events I signed up for, anyway).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s okay for me to bring this embarrassing experience up, because it&rsquo;s built me up to be a better athlete and a better person.</p>

<p>If you really want to achieve your goals, don&rsquo;t let the failures in the middle of the process stop you: it&rsquo;s okay to dwell on them for a short time, but pick yourself up, get better, and try again, because ultimately, you write the story of your life.</p>
