        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Hello everyone. Let me share a productivity tip that I&rsquo;ve been using for years. It&rsquo;s called the Pomodoro technique. The one sentence summary is that you work in blocks of 25 minutes at a time, resting for five minutes in between. After every four Pomodoros, you can take a longer break (typically 15-20 minutes).
I&rsquo;ve been using this technique since I started actually programming professionally. It&rsquo;s really helped me over the last 5 years.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Folks, this is about blocking out social media during the work day. You&rsquo;re free to use social media for whatever purposes you want in your free time! But if you&rsquo;re like me, who gets easily distracted, and sometimes doesn&rsquo;t do good work because of all the self-inflicted interruptions, I might have something for you.
For the past six or so weeks, I&rsquo;ve been hitting 50+ productive hours a week. I&rsquo;ve coded a ton, learned a new programming language, read 5++ books, published 5++ blog posts, biked 20++ times and more than 1000 kilometers, and created my speech for an upcoming work conference.
