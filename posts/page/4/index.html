    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Over the past few months I&rsquo;ve learned a lot of different programming languages and web development techniques: ReactJS/&ldquo;modern&rdquo; JavaScript, Redis, Domain-Driven Design, Elixir/Phoenix, and AWS/Chef/Docker. While I&rsquo;m still at various levels from newbie to intermediate, I think I&rsquo;ve gotten a better grasp of how to learn new technologies now. Here&rsquo;s how I did it:
 Devote a few hours reading about the possible use case of that technology. For 2018, my goal was to expand to full-stack status (front-end framework to Rails to servers).

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Antifragile by Nassim Nicolas Taleb was really difficult to read: I can deal with his incessant ranting, but he really loves using complicated words and long paragraphs. Here are some things I took away from this book.
On fragility: while fragile objects like porcelain cups break apart when shocked or stressed, antifragile concepts benefit from those. This probably confirms what I think about re: investing time and money on online courses, books, and studying over clothes and luxury goods, because knowledge stays with you, as long as you apply it, and material possessions can get lost, destroyed, or stolen.

      When things don&rsquo;t go our way, it&rsquo;s easy to rationalize by thinking of every single excuse: &ldquo;I was tired that day&rdquo;, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to work for that company anyway&rdquo;, &ldquo;The system is against me&rdquo;.
When I was transferring colleges after flunking out of engineering, the Tourism college secretary didn&rsquo;t accept my transfer request because of a low GPA.
For your information Mr. Secretary, this &ldquo;low&rdquo; GPA was because of my (irrelevant to your course) engineering classes heavily skewed that number!

      Get the money. Get the money, and then let’s get around a table, and let’s create new rules.
It is going to be made, it is going to be allocated, and you have a moral imperative to make sure that if you have a point of view that matters, and you want to reflect it, you get it.
It will be about a competition of views. Money drives the world, for better or for worse.

      The story doesn&rsquo;t end until you choose for it to end. I learned this story the hard way when I was still trying to develop my mind and my mental toughness.
In order for me to become a UP mountaineer, I needed to run 15 kilometers in 1 hour and 45 minutes.
Because of my lack of preparation, both physically and mentally, I struggled mightily, and at one point, I yelled out in frustration to my friends who were helping me, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how I feel!

      I&rsquo;ve been intermittent fasting over the last month or so, and the results have been dramatic: I&rsquo;ve lost 10 pounds in the last 6 weeks.
Disclaimer: I&rsquo;m not a doctor, so try this at your own risk!
This is done without losing fitness as I can somehow bike faster, and I&rsquo;ve been doing some core exercises: I actually feel stronger, despite the weight loss!
My intermittent fasting schedule varies from day to day, but I try to keep my eating window within 6-8 hours: during most days, I start breaking my fast at 2-2:30pm, and eat my last meal at around 8-8:30 pm.

      Today, I rode a climb up Tagaytay, Sungay In the Philippines. It&rsquo;s an inhuman climb, with gradients at 15% in the straighter sections and up to 25% in the corners. It&rsquo;s a climb that is difficult to walk on, never mind riding a bike though.
It&rsquo;s often at the edge of our ability that every thing we put in matters. While I&rsquo;ve been religiously training on the bike for the past few months, and I&rsquo;ve been using a road bike for two years, the Sungay climb&rsquo;s ridiculous gradients exposed me.

      Always ask yourself: is there an easier, faster, and better way of doing things?
If there is, then follow up by asking, would the time spent learning that way save time in the long-term?
I first came into contact with the text editor I use for writing my programs (Vim) 4 years ago, and while it was a nightmare to learn I knew that if I just buckled down and forced myself to learn it for the next 20-100 hours, it would pay off at some point.

      Hello everyone. Let me share a productivity tip that I&rsquo;ve been using for years. It&rsquo;s called the Pomodoro technique. The one sentence summary is that you work in blocks of 25 minutes at a time, resting for five minutes in between. After every four Pomodoros, you can take a longer break (typically 15-20 minutes).
I&rsquo;ve been using this technique since I started actually programming professionally. It&rsquo;s really helped me over the last 5 years.

      Read: The Art of Manliness articles on focusing. Reading: Incognito: The Secret Lives of the Brain, by David Eagleman. Reading: Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns. Wrote: Blog entry on decluttering. Writing: My speech for Rubyconf! :) Biked: 155km. Coding. Forever project: Daryllxd.  I added a started_at and ended_at to the table. This is huge. The goal of the eternal side project is to keep me productive, and I&rsquo;ve noticed that I can get carried away doing frivolous things from time to time.

        Good Habits: The 100 Things Challenge
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Summary:
 I have 103 things. Having few, high quality things has made my life easier because I don&rsquo;t have to think that much. The point of the challenge is not having a limit, but limiting consumption. Impulse buys are the worst. Whenever you want to buy something, don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll miss out if you don&rsquo;t buy it. Just wait for a few days before actually buying the thing.  I first heard about the 100 Things Challenge when I was a college student.

      Getting the Visa (Philippines): Visa requirements are on the Korean embassy page.
If your parents are retired (they don&rsquo;t have an ITR), you can use your ITR as a substitute. My brother is in school so I used my ITR since I was sponsoring his trip.
I don&rsquo;t think you need to be physically present when applying for the Visa. We forgot a requirement (my brother&rsquo;s school certificate) the first time we got there so we re-applied a few days after.

      I&rsquo;ve decided to start blogging again. And this time I want to stick to this for good (like for the rest of my life). A few years back I did the Project 365 thing where you took a picture of the day for 365 days. I really liked that year since I actively tried to do something per day so surely writing about things should have that kind of effect 😱
