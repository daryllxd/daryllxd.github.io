        <h1 class="catalogue-title">Good Habits: The 100 Things Challenge</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Summary:
 I have 103 things. Having few, high quality things has made my life easier because I don&rsquo;t have to think that much. The point of the challenge is not having a limit, but limiting consumption. Impulse buys are the worst. Whenever you want to buy something, don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll miss out if you don&rsquo;t buy it. Just wait for a few days before actually buying the thing.  I first heard about the 100 Things Challenge when I was a college student.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Getting the Visa (Philippines): Visa requirements are on the Korean embassy page.
If your parents are retired (they don&rsquo;t have an ITR), you can use your ITR as a substitute. My brother is in school so I used my ITR since I was sponsoring his trip.
I don&rsquo;t think you need to be physically present when applying for the Visa. We forgot a requirement (my brother&rsquo;s school certificate) the first time we got there so we re-applied a few days after.

            I&rsquo;ve decided to start blogging again. And this time I want to stick to this for good (like for the rest of my life). A few years back I did the Project 365 thing where you took a picture of the day for 365 days. I really liked that year since I actively tried to do something per day so surely writing about things should have that kind of effect üò±
