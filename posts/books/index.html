        <p>Post objective: To get people to read more books.</p>

<p>When I was a kid I really liked to read books. I&rsquo;m just that kind of nerd. Books were my favortie past time. I remember waiting every weekend when my mom, Jerico, and I would go out during the weekends and she would buy me 1 book. I efven finished ROald Dahl and shit.</p>

<p>Then came video games and I was just addicted to them. They wree a higher stimulus than books.</p>

<p>But recently I want to read books again. It all started when I was thinking to myself, I want to get better at making conversations. I want to have actionable things on how to be better at this because Iwant to get my ideas out. Not just in terms of technical terms . It started with How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People. Now I&rsquo;ve read 15 books over the past 5 months.</p>

<p>What are the thing I thought about?</p>

<ul>
<li>Versus video games? I still love video games but I don&rsquo;t really get much out of them nowadays. Plus they&rsquo;re so damn complicated now that when I play, I just play the ones I played before (Dota, Counter-Strike).</li>
<li>Think of</li>
<li>It costs money: Some of them don&rsquo;t really cost much. I bought this Elon Musk book for literally $2. And some of them are really much more. I think of it this way: I spend $5 (200 pesos) on a movie which lasts 2 hours. Why shouldn&rsquo;t I spend $10 on a book that helps me for not that much more?</li>
<li>It makes me feel like I have these people on my side. If you look at most of the authors coaching seminars they cost a lot, and deservingly so because you use up their time. A book is more non-coimmittal. It really does</li>
<li>On Kindle vs physical books: I still like the feeling of a physical book more than reading off a screen. But what I like about the screen is that I have.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some books that have changed my life:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not a book, but an article: <a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-harsh-truths-that-will-make-you-better-person/">Reference</a>.</li>
