<div class="post-line"></div>

		

		<p>A huge life goal of mine is to create a body of work that I can ultimately look back on and be proud of. I&rsquo;m hoping to build some software that helps a lot of people, or write a blog post that gets someone to take control of their life, or possibly speak at a conference and inspire someone to build their own empire.</p>

<p>If that is to be a reality, then I&rsquo;ll have to put in a certain number of repetitive deliberate practice. The metaphor behind reps in weight lifting is that the process of lifting heavy stuff literally tears your muscles, and after a period of recovery, they&rsquo;ll be bigger and better than before.</p>

<p>This mirrors the programming process–every day, I&rsquo;m stretching my brain out to its maximum capacity in my effort to create code and applications that I&rsquo;m proud off.</p>

<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t have the audacity to think that my life goals are achievable in a span of a few months or even a few years: five years in as a professional programmer and there&rsquo;s still a ton of programming left for me to learn.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to lie–there are times where I think, &ldquo;When am I going to create something that is of some value to the world?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whenever those thoughts drift in to my mind, I remind myself that that the only thing keeping me from getting to be a better programmer is a few thousand more hours of deliberate practice.</p>

<p>The next x years would be more of the same: trying to get better, failing a lot, making mistakes, hopefully correcting them, and putting in my heart and soul in my work.</p>

<p>Until then, it&rsquo;s a bunch of the next years of repeating the same day: programming, learning, writing, and cycling, and putting in more reps.</p>
