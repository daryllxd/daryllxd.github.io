<li><p>Spoke at Rubyconf Philippines! Yeah!</p></li>

<li><p>Coding:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ruby/Rails: I just said &ldquo;f it&rdquo; and got Transcripto up to a workable state re: reading talks. I just need to deploy it. It&rsquo;s not so easy to deploy to Heroku anymore, so now I&rsquo;m definitely going to use AWS for my deploys.</li>
<li>Elixir/Phoenix: Got Habits Two to a point where I can add Habits. It&rsquo;s really hard to transition to Ecto from ActiveRecord, but only because they&rsquo;re two different libraries. Ecto is &ldquo;granularly add functionality.&rdquo; AR is &ldquo;here&rsquo;s everything you need.&rdquo;</li>
<li>I also sucked it up and really moved forward with React, I&rsquo;m about 2 or 3 chapters from Redux. I want to get to Redux first before I integrate and create the front-end for the Daryllxd app. I actually get how it works now, I just need to put some reps and look at the framework. You probably notice that I love frameworks. I don&rsquo;t love reinventing the wheel.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="speaking-at-rubyconfph">Speaking at RubyconfPH</h2>

<p>This whole week started off with me still coding, but at the middle of the week, things really went to Rubyconf mode. To be completely honest, I&rsquo;m not scared of speaking in front of a hundred people. I just look at the front of the room anyways. I just remember that I can speak to anyone, and it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m speaking to one hundred people one hundred times.</p>

<p>I am scared though of my filler words during the talk. Because of that, I wrote everything down on the slide notes. While that solves the problem of filler words, you don&rsquo;t want to be reading everything off the slides. I abandoned reading the slides midway through the presentation.</p>

<p>While I practiced the material tons of times on my own, I didn&rsquo;t practice actually standing up and giving the talk. So I went over the limit. Lesson learned. Practice more and more and practice everything.</p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m happy with the result. Not to toot my own horn but I objectively think the talk was okay. I&rsquo;ve had a few people tell me that they liked it and they got something from it. I saw a few people taking photos of the slides, and one of the people I look up to in the Philippine Ruby community chatted with me on Twitter about it. Oh well, that&rsquo;s done! Yay!</p>

<h2 id="being-at-rubyconfph">Being at RubyConfPH</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been to all five RubyConfPHs. It&rsquo;s mirrored my Rails developer progress, seeing as I didn&rsquo;t even have a job when I went to the first one. For the next three iterations, I was a Sourcepad employee. In this fifth edition, I came (walked in? ðŸ˜‚) as a speaker.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an active benchmark of my current skills against other people taking the same journey as I am. It reminds me of &ldquo;oh yeah, I should probably be applying myself more&rdquo;. I also like that I slowly get to understand the talks year by year. Progress!</p>

<p>I think of web development shops as middle-age guilds, and RubyConfPH as the annual guild meeting: the different Ruby companies all meet up at one place to talk about their craft. And honestly, I thought the whole &ldquo;Ruby programmers are nice&rdquo; was just a buzz phrase, but as I&rsquo;ve spoken with tens of them throughout the years, it&rsquo;s actually true. I really like chatting and making new friends with fellow Rubyists.</p>

<h2 id="tidbits">Tidbits:</h2>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been really listening to &ldquo;In Motion&rdquo; (The Social Network OST) lately. It&rsquo;s started to replace &ldquo;Music for 18 Musicians&rdquo; as my song of choice while coding. I wrote the core of my Rubyconf talk to that music.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve also concretized a new idea that isn&rsquo;t completely new. I&rsquo;m currently using it every time I&rsquo;m too shy to put my work out there. It&rsquo;s called the &ldquo;One Fucker&rdquo; effect. I got this from Gary Vaynerchuk in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDgLEio-YL0">his video.</a> It&rsquo;s around the five minute mark. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to sit here and make this video, hoping that one fucker, one fucker says, &lsquo;oh shit&rsquo;.&rdquo;  So yeah. If I come across or create something that I believe can genuinely improve someone else&rsquo;s life, why the hell shouldn&rsquo;t I share it?</li>
<li>It was my last week of the Base Training II program for my bike. Yeah progress! I wasn&rsquo;t able to actually bike that much at the end, but I was able to sort-of finish 8 weeks of training. I&rsquo;ll begin a new training program this week.</li>
