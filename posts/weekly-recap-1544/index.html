<p>On the 1544rd week of my life, I:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095">Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</a></li>
<li>Listened to: <a href="https://fs.blog/naval-ravikant/">Naval Ravikant: The Angel Philosopher on Investing, Making Decisions, Happiness and the Meaning of Life</a></li>
<li>Fasted: 50 hours. Yeah!</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>Note: This is me backfilling posts from the weekly series. I had not been keeping up to date, well where it is!</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently reading up a ton on how being a foreign worker in Singapore is like. From my understanding, it will take 2-3 weeks for Singapore&rsquo;s Ministry of Manpower to come up with results for a work pass. Well, I&rsquo;m 99% sure I&rsquo;ll get it because I don&rsquo;t have a criminal record anyway, but it&rsquo;s crazy how insidious the 1% of my brain is telling me that &ldquo;no you will get rejected&rdquo;. While preparing for the worst of a process is good, if it&rsquo;s not constructive, then what&rsquo;s the use?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also thinking about what kind of place I&rsquo;ll move in to. I honestly have very few requirements: I just need a place that is quiet enough that I can think and code and enough space for me to have a bike, have a bike trainer, and allow me to bike indoors. That&rsquo;s basically it. So I have to think about roommates because the rent in Singapore is damn expensive.</p>

<p>On the 24th, my brother Jerico came over and we played Settlers of Catan (my dad, my 2 brothers, and I). It&rsquo;s so weird to me that this is happening since we haven&rsquo;t done social things in a long time. I feel like we&rsquo;ve always been studying and silo-ed in our own little worlds and computers that having an offline bonding experience is really worth it.</p>

<ul>
<li>50 hour fast! I just vaguely remember this but I do remember the part that near the end, I rode my bike for like 20 minutes. I felt like dying lol.</li>
<li>My UE friends and I ate at a buffet in Cubao. It was my last buffet in the Philippines.</li>
</ul>
