        <p>
            Draft  Over the past few months I&rsquo;ve been eating the same few nutritious meals. I&rsquo;m very lucky to live near a store that sells salads for $2. As such I can live most days getting my vegetables.
There are some days where I deviate from the norm, though. At some point in the day I break down and buy a bag of chips. I consume and binge those chips.
