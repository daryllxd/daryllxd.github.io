		<p>Today, I rode a climb up Tagaytay, Sungay In the Philippines. It&rsquo;s an inhuman climb, with gradients at 15% in the straighter sections and up to 25% in the corners. It&rsquo;s a climb that is difficult to walk on, never mind riding a bike though.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s often at the edge of our ability that every thing we put in matters. While I&rsquo;ve been religiously training on the bike for the past few months, and I&rsquo;ve been using a road bike for two years, the Sungay climb&rsquo;s ridiculous gradients exposed me.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all the little things - me not having cleats means I couldn&rsquo;t do a &ldquo;pull&rdquo; action with my hamstrings, me having a backpack means it&rsquo;s harder for me to sit up straight, me having brought a camera means I have more weight which gravity likes.</p>

<p>While I was able to get away with all of those things at 10% to 12%, when it comes the highest level, I floundered.</p>

<p>This is what I love about cycling and generally being in the mountains: you&rsquo;ll get exposed if you didn&rsquo;t squeeze the juice from the stone.</p>

<p>I can say that from a technical standpoint, I failed in that climb. I wasn&rsquo;t able to one-shot it and I dismounted and walked multiple times.</p>

<p>What I did get was valuable feedback and learnings. I&rsquo;ll be back, Sungay.</p>
