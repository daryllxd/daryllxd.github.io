		<p><em>Get the money. Get the money, and then let’s get around a table, and let’s create new rules.</em></p>

<p><em>It is going to be made, it is going to be allocated, and you have a moral imperative to make sure that if you have a point of view that matters, and you want to reflect it, you get it.</em></p>

<p><em>It will be about a competition of views. Money drives the world, for better or for worse. Economic incentives drive entire swaths of populations to behave in very, very, predictable — and then when you take it away, unpredictable — ways.</em></p>

<p><em>Spend time to think about what your worldview is, so that when you control some of these purse-strings, you push that view into the world.</em></p>

<p><em>- <a href="http://chamatharchive.com/get-the-fucking-money/">Chamath Palihapatiya</a></em></p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of Chamath over the past few days and I think this view, that money drives a society for better or for worse, is exemplified in all units of society (families, companies, and the world). And ultimately, that&rsquo;s how societies work: it&rsquo;s on us to accumulate enough capital and power to impose our worldviews on societies.</p>

<p>Honestly, it was only after I&rsquo;d demonstrated that I have the capability to earn a substantial salary that my parents truly began to start respecting my decision making process. This is not a shot at them-I had a bad academic track record and flunked out of university before, and so I needed to prove myself to them by putting in the work to become a competent programmer.</p>

<p>Family breadwinners get to choose how a family&rsquo;s culture is. CEOs and board members and business owners get to choose how their organizations operate. And at a big enough scale, people who control the money get to choose what roads are worth building, companies are worth funding, and what problems are worth solving.</p>

<p>Looking forward fifty years from now, I hope I&rsquo;ll be in a position where I&rsquo;ve accumulated intellectual, business, and financial capital so that I can put some of my world view and values out there: I think everyone should have at least a chance to try to pursue what they want in life.</p>

<p>To even come close to making that a reality, I need to work on the micro and the day to day: applying myself and becoming the best person I can be so I can develop the best value I can to a company and their users/clients.</p>

<p>It seems really idealistic just typing this out, and there&rsquo;s a very little chance that this works out, but I might as well try it rather than regret not trying it when I get older.</p>
