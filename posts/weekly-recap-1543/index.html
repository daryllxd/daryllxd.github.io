<h1 id="hello-tradegecko">Hello TradeGecko</h1>

<p>Okay I&rsquo;m really hoping that this is going to push through (I&rsquo;m writing this on June 24, because I crammed this part hehe) but I&rsquo;m at a 99.9% certainty already, so. I&rsquo;ve accepted a new job offer at <a href="https://www.tradegecko.com/">TradeGecko Singapore</a> as a senior developer. Yeah&hellip; It&rsquo;s so weird to say this because when I graduated back in 2014, I was just dreaming of being a senior developer, and now it&rsquo;s officially here. Really proud of myself. I busted my ass, put in thousands of hours of study and work, had the trials and tribulations, felt good, felt bad, but yeah I&rsquo;ve sort of made it at least on an international level.</p>

<p>If any future officemates read this, hello guys, thank you for trusting me. I&rsquo;ll do my best :)</p>

<li>Posted for the first time in x months asking for Singapore things.

<ul>
<li>People from all parts of my life had things to say.</li>
<li>Really grateful for this</li>

<li>Ever since I was young, I&rsquo;ve been competitive in everything that I did, but now that I&rsquo;m growing older, I can&rsquo;t recall any successful person that isn&rsquo;t competitive. This doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean being competitive with others. I think being competitive with your best version of yourself is extremely important.

<ul>
<li>Sourcepad: In a company-wide hackathon, a day where literally nothing is done except code a cool prototype of company-beneficial software, people JUST WENT HARD. In my last Sourcepad hackathon, we (Nikki, Virna, Rav, and Erik) meta-gamed the hell out of the criteria - good design/good screens, a skit when we presented the app, some &ldquo;machine learning&rdquo; that sort of worked, an answer to basically every question that was going to get asked. We won :)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Bringing an A-Game, Competition</p>

<p>All good employees/high performers are usually competitive AF.</p>

<ul>
<li>Everything in life ties up. How I react to other people outside of the workplace, my personality type, what I do, what I read, what I like, who I interact with, what I&rsquo;m paid for, how I view the world. So it&rsquo;s in my best interest to understand everything I can so I can operate with more complete information so I can make better decisions to push things in the decision that I want.</li>
<li>This is why biking is important, hiking is important, chatting with good friends are important, being around good friends are important.</li>
<li>You have one brain and one body. You have to train that body and that brain to be the best it can possibly be.</li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s like my job is to assimilate those ideas and crystallize them into something that adds value to the world.</p>
