<h2 id="life-updates">Life updates</h2>

<p>My main objective for this week was to learn the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir_(programming_language)">Elixir programming language</a> and make something productive with it. All the cool Rails developers seem to be migrating to Elixir. Plus, I haven&rsquo;t learned a language in three years.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m enjoying it. It&rsquo;s easier to learn a programming language if you know others already. I can draw upon my Ruby and Rails experience to help me learn Elixir and Phoenix. Much of the first few days has been &ldquo;how do I implement <code>&lt;insert Ruby command&gt;</code> in <code>&lt;insert Elixir command&gt;</code>. I know that this limits my development to &ldquo;Elixir language features that are also implemented in Ruby&rdquo;, but for now, it&rsquo;s okay. I&rsquo;ll get to the Elixir-specific features later.</p>

<p>My app for Elixir is Habits One, a habit tracking app. A user can put in their habit, then every day they can manually flag if they do the habit or not. That&rsquo;s the core of the app. I&rsquo;ll show a screenshot when I have a prototype up.</p>

<p>My tactics on learning Elixir:</p>

<ul>
<li>I learn fastest by reading a book, so I got a copy of both Programming Elixir and Programming Phoenix. Since my goal is to create an application, I also needed to learn the Phoenix web framework.</li>
<li>Write my sample project. I hate writing code that I won&rsquo;t use. I really wanted to make a habits tracking app anyway, so I might as well do it in the language I want to learn. Elixir also has a language feature which makes it easier to send notifications/updates to users. I imagine that this would be very important in the app that I&rsquo;m making.</li>
<li>I spent a few hours working on mechanics via <a href="https://github.com/elixirkoans/elixir-koans">Elixir Koans.</a>. Koans are a set of exercises designed to burn language features in your brain. It&rsquo;s like flashcards for developers. It&rsquo;s a way for me to be more familiar and comfortable with the language.</li>
<li>Reading other projects. Reading how code is structured. Looking at a sample project so I can have a basis on how things work and I can do the code comparison thing when I have a bug. <a href="https://github.com/gothinkster/elixir-phoenix-realworld-example-app">This is the project I&rsquo;m basing my work on.</a></li>
<li>After each day, I write TILs (Today I learned). That way I can marinate the ideas in my head.</li>
<li>Try not to get sidetracked. This is my problem: I keep on getting sidetracked by reading documentation and blog articles. I get to know some other features of the language, but I fall in a rabbit hole and I still haven&rsquo;t finished the book!</li>
<li>Just grind it out. I don&rsquo;t care if other people are faster than me or are better than me. For example, there&rsquo;s a chapter in the book about concurrency. I don&rsquo;t really understand everything at first pass but I know I can get back to it later. Or I can browse a screencast, or muck around and try to make my own.</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, see you. I need to write my speech!</p>
