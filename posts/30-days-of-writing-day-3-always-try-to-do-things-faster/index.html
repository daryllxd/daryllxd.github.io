        30 Days of Writing, Day 3: Always try to do things faster.

        <p>Always ask yourself: is there an easier, faster, and better way of doing things?</p>

<p>If there is, then follow up by asking, would the time spent learning that way save time in the long-term?</p>

<p>I first came into contact with the text editor I use for writing my programs (Vim) 4 years ago, and while it was a nightmare to learn I knew that if I just buckled down and forced myself to learn it for the next 20-100 hours, it would pay off at some point.</p>

<p>This meant rewiring an entire lifetime of how a person would use a text editor: for instance, it&rsquo;s discouraged to scroll with the arrow keys. You scroll up, down, left, and right with the k, j, h, and l keys.</p>

<p>Once my brain got rewired and this new editor became part of my muscle memory, my productivity skyrocketed: I can quickly move and edit files faster than before, and I can do it without moving my right hand from the keyboard over to my mouse.</p>

<p>If that action took 1 second to complete and I do that 500 times a day, then not having to move my hand would save me roughly eight and a half minutes per day. Spread over 300 days a year (I also use Vim to write and edit blog posts such as this) and that leads to roughly 40 hours (an whole work week per year!).</p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t count all the other shortcuts I&rsquo;ve added to OS X, Kindle, Chrome, and every single program that I use consistently. Always try to figure out who you can do things easier, faster, and better.</p>
