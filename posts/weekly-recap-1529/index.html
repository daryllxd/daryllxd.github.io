<li>Coding:

<ul>
<li>Added Doorkeeper/JWT/controller layer to Daryllxd.</li>
<li>Added another view to Daryllxd re: summarizing activity tags for the week. This is to keep me honest re: my programming efforts. I can hit 50 hours a week of productive time but if I don&rsquo;t at least have 25 programming hours, then I&rsquo;d say the week wasn&rsquo;t a success. I&rsquo;m thinking of new ways to categorize things, too.</li>
<li>Started <a href="https://reactjs.org/">ReactJS</a> training again. This time, I have two big motivation factors: I&rsquo;ll actually be using it to create the front-end of Daryllxd, and I actually spent money (I accidentally used the Sourcepad credit card, sorry Sam and Jed) to buy a book (Full Stack React). So I&rsquo;m definitely invested in it.</li>
<li>Started the <a href="https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate">Amazon Web Services Certified Solutions Architect-Associate</a> course on Udemy. The course was normally priced $179.99, but I got it for $19.99 via a flash sale. I always wanted to formalize my knowledge of AWS anyway.</li>
<li>Devoted my Sunday coding to Elixir. I was not able to finish the &ldquo;User can add a habit and User can view a list of habits&rdquo; yet, but I discovered some more language features.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="life-updates">Life Updates</h2>

<p>Last week, I worked on Rails code and did some architectural changes to Daryllxd, my life tracking software. This week, I split time between the front-end (ReactJS), back-end (Ruby/Domain Driven Design), and the server (AWS). While this might seem like I&rsquo;m spreading my brain too thin, I find that I&rsquo;ve been able to find recurring patterns that help me in the three disciplines. Also, because I operate with strict time limits for the three, I just cut down to the chase and try to sprint for my objectives for the day.</p>

<p>My short- and medium-term goal for the front-end is to create an actual web interface for the Daryllxd app. I&rsquo;m seeing the limitations of a command line interface: while it&rsquo;s sort of faster for me to <em>insert</em> data, I can&rsquo;t use the command line to make graphs and advanced tables. I need JavaScript for those!</p>

<p>Honestly, I&rsquo;ve never felt comfortable with JavaScript,  but I need to relearn this in order to become a full-stack developer again.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="tidbits">Tidbits:</h2>

<ul>
<li>I created a Youtube video for my job application this week. While they told me to do a short one-minute intro, I went all out with it and made my &ldquo;Vlog, Episode 1&rdquo; anyway. It took me nearly half of Monday but whatever, I really enjoyed busting out Premiere for the first time in so long. I actually like video editing and it&rsquo;s nice to put clips together to create a narrative. Creating this video is actually inspiring me to vlog more.</li>
<li>After months of being in less than optimal condition, my bike is finally fixed! While it&rsquo;s been usable for indoor rides, I was always weary of taking it outside because of something faulty in the transmission. It took less time than I thought: about 3 hours total to replace the tunnel guide/bottom bracket, realign the wheels, and tune the derailleurs. It&rsquo;s working like a charm now, and I think I&rsquo;m ready for some hills again.</li>
</ul>
