		<p>You&rsquo;ll meet several thousands of people in your life, and they have their own viewpoints and stories and whatever, and you&rsquo;ll disagree with them a fair amount of times given a life time, but you should always remembers one thing: they&rsquo;re not always wrong, and you&rsquo;re not always right.</p>

<p>You have to fight the innate human instinct to short-circuit decision making which incentivizes making a snap judgment on an idea based on its messenger. Well, I guess you can do the short-circuiting thing if it&rsquo;s just a small thing, but for big life decisions, you cannot be that fickle. Remember that growth and idea is what matters, not your personal biases.</p>

<p>As someone living in a poor country who (someday) wants to immigrate to a better life in a richer country, in order to contribute to the bleeding edge of humanity, I don&rsquo;t agree with Trump and his immigration policies. But to disregard everything he says or everything he does is naive: I can take a lesson from &ldquo;how to get better at public speaking&rdquo;, &ldquo;how to be convince others with your arguments&rdquo;, and read parts of his life and take what I can to improve my life.</p>

<p>People have several ingredients to their personality: How would you feel if your entire being was invalidated based on one idea that you had? There was one person I particularly didn&rsquo;t like, but was a good cook, so I just got good cooking tips from her anyway. And while I don&rsquo;t agree with her beliefs, I thank her for those cooking tips.</p>

<p>This is something that I have to practice more, but at least I know that it exists. I&rsquo;ll consolidate this idea/blog posts as I discover new things.&rdquo;</p>
