<div class="post-line"></div>

		

		<p>In my junior and senior years in college, I had absolutely nothing going for me (horrible grades, very few friends, and no money) that I based my self-worth off my greatest &ldquo;strength&rdquo; at the time, which was video games and Magic: The Gathering.</p>

<p>A really low point was when I was trying to construct a resume to look for a call center job after I had been expelled from my collegeâ€”asides from the schools I attended, I couldn&rsquo;t write anything.</p>

<p>No job would take someone with &ldquo;Magic: The Gathering Friday Night Magic tournament winner&rdquo; as one&rsquo;s highest achievement.</p>

<p>From that moment on, I based my self-worth on something that I would be proud of: learning and having skills that can help me and other people. I started with learning how to speak neutrally-accented English and answering work interview questions, and just to prove that I would do whatever it takes to get into a call center, I only spoke English in the last 2 weeks before my planned job interview.</p>

<p>That seems like a million years ago, and I&rsquo;m a completely different person now, but the strategy of &ldquo;learn this, no matter what it takes&rdquo; has been applied several times and thousands of hours over to learn programming, design, exercise/hiking skills, cycling, cooking/nutrition, public speaking, negotiating, marketing, and will be applied to accumulate and improve skills for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>Try to make your self-worth based on something that you actually care about: your sense of self-worth will be the backbone and the foundation of how you live your life. Basing your self-worth on other people&rsquo;s approval, or money, or achievements and awards, or beauty would lead to you getting depressed when those things are taken away.</p>

<p>Feel free to also use learning/skill as a temporary or perhaps even permanent basis of self-worth: it&rsquo;s something you can do every day, and something that accumulates beautifully with time. I hope this change brings as much value and contentment to your life as it has with mine.</p>
