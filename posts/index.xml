      <description>Getting the Visa (Philippines): Visa requirements are on the Korean embassy page.
If your parents are retired (they don&amp;rsquo;t have an ITR), you can use your ITR as a substitute. My brother is in school so I used my ITR since I was sponsoring his trip.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think you need to be physically present when applying for the Visa. We forgot a requirement (my brother&amp;rsquo;s school certificate) the first time we got there so we re-applied a few days after.</description>
