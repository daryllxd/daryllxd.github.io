      <description>Getting the Visa (Philippines): Visa requirements are on the Korean embassy page.
If your parents are retired (don&amp;rsquo;t have an ITR), you can use your ITR as a substitute. My brother is in school so I used my ITR since I was sponsoring his trip.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think you need to be physically present when applying for the Visa. We forgot a requirement (my brother&amp;rsquo;s school certificate) the first time we got there so we re-applied a few days after.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start blogging again. And this time I want to stick to this for good (like for the rest of my life). A few years back I did the Project 365 thing where you took a picture of the day for 365 days. I really liked that year since I actively tried to do something per day so surely writing about things should have that kind of effect ðŸ˜±</description>
