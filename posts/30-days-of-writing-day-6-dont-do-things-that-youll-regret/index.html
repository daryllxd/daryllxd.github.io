		<p>You choose the suffering you want to experience. &ldquo;Suffer the pain of discipline or suffer the pain of regret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I struggle (and groan at the words that I&rsquo;m typing) to think and push through with this article, I know that at any time, I can just switch to a new tab and continue mindlessly browsing Twitter and Hacker News.</p>

<p>The problem with doing that is that I know that I&rsquo;ll hate myself in the morning when the feeling of having skipped a day clouds over me, and I&rsquo;d rather just kludge through writing this post even if I&rsquo;m really sleepy and tired.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found that basing my actions around &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do things that you know you&rsquo;ll regret in the future&rdquo; has really improved my decision making and general contentment. I write these words knowing that this is just part of the process of getting better at the craft of writing.</p>

<p>At some point in the past, my writing was truly, truly horrendous, and at some point in the future, I&rsquo;ll be passable, and at some point even further than that, I can probably even be good.</p>

<p>All I need is just a few more hundred hours of practice and struggle. On to Day 7!</p>
