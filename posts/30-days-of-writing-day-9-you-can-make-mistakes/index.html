		<p>Unfortunately, I wasn&rsquo;t able to write this blog post on time, as I slept before pushing this article out. I could rationalize and say that I was too tired, but I had an entire day (and to be quite honest, I only really need less than an hour) to do this, and I didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s okay. You can&rsquo;t expect every day to go the way you want to. What&rsquo;s important is you pick yourself back up and try again the next day.</p>

<p>Missing one day of progress shouldn&rsquo;t be a reason for you to just say &ldquo;screw it&rdquo; and just quit on pursuing your goals. If you quit after just one day of skipping, you probably didn&rsquo;t want that goal in the first place.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not a bad thing, if it&rsquo;s really true: I have about 20 hours in &ldquo;trying&rdquo; to be an animator, and I quit midway, because it I was so damn disinterested in it that I would rather watch the wall in front of me than continue with Macromedia Flash, lol.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a career path that I have total respect for, but I have no regrets when I say that I tried to, and I will most likely never be, an animator.</p>

<p>If your inside voice is telling you though that you really want to do this goal that you set out to do, then remember that it&rsquo;s a marathon, not a sprint, write that 10 sentences, and continue on with the process.</p>
