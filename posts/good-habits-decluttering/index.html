<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>I have 103 things. Having few, high quality things has made my life easier because I don&rsquo;t have to think that much.</li>
<li>The point of the challenge is not having a limit, but limiting consumption.</li>
<li>Impulse buys are the worst. Whenever you want to buy something, don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll miss out if you don&rsquo;t buy it. Just wait for a few days before actually buying the thing.</li>
</ol>

<p>I first heard about the 100 Things Challenge when I was a college student. I&rsquo;ve been following it for a few years. At first it was easy to do since I didn&rsquo;t really buy things when I was a student, but when I started working, it became harder to maintain, especially with stylish co-workers with their 10+ pairs of shoes and their never-repeating clothes. I&rsquo;ve cut back on my spending though, and here are all my things in the world:</p>

<p>For most things, I prefer the higher quality versions. The problem with cheap stuff is that they break down so easily, and you regret buying them. I&rsquo;ve had most of my camping stuff intact for the past two years since they never broke down anyway. My cookset&rsquo;s been with me for the past 5 years.</p>

<p>Clothes are the big thing. At first you&rsquo;ll feel weird wearing close to the same clothes every day, but you&rsquo;ll realize that people don&rsquo;t care. I don&rsquo;t have shirts that I don&rsquo;t like wearing. So, every shirt is my favorite shirt. Making decisions on what to wear is easy especially because I have the same color scheme anyway (black, olive green, maroon, navy blue, dark grey). Just pick the clothes at the top of your drawer and don&rsquo;t pick pants that are the same color. Then add stylish shoes and you&rsquo;re good to go!</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re trying a hobby out, you can start with the cheaper things first. I used to have a folding bike when I was just learning how to ride it. I rode that bike until it broke down and was unrepairable. Seeing as there were multiple benefits in biking to work, I decided to upgrade to a faster and lighter road bike.</p>

<p>That bike is the most expensive non-programming thing on that list, and it has more than paid for itself with the amount of money and time it saves.</p>

<p>The point of being minimalist is intentionality. Just have the things you need. 100 is literally a number. I don&rsquo;t really care about violating the rule because I&rsquo;ve used every single thing in that list in the past months. (Well, everything except the hammock.)</p>

<p>To start, just start segregating your stuff. Be really ruthless on if you need those things or not. I&rsquo;ve actually just started segregating things again-I&rsquo;ve bought some stupid crap lately, and it turns out that I still had too many shirts.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll continue this article next time. But I have to ship! :)</p>
