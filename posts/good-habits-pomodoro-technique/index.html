<p>Hello everyone. Let me share a productivity tip that I&rsquo;ve been using for years. It&rsquo;s called the Pomodoro technique.  The one sentence summary is that you work in blocks of 25 minutes at a time, resting for five minutes in between. After every four Pomodoros, you can take a longer break (typically 15-20 minutes).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using this technique since I started actually programming professionally. It&rsquo;s really helped me over the last 5 years. You can read the <a href="https://francescocirillo.com/pages/-technique">official site</a> documentation, as well as other blog posts on the topic, but here are my tactics on how I use it as a software developer.</p>

<h2 id="the-goal">The Goal</h2>

<p>My current goals (March 2018) are to improve my software development skills (and learn Elixir/relearn Javascript), write 100 blog posts, read 50 books, and get better at the bike (increase power while losing weight).</p>

<p>Those are not easy tasks at all. Based on experience, I&rsquo;m cooked after about 5 hours of difficult programming tasks. I can still code light tasks after, but any more than 1 hour excess of focused work would leave me drained the next day.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found that maintaining a strict schedule, guided by the Pomodoro technique&rsquo;s split of focused work and rest, has allowed me to get more done in a shorter amount of time.</p>

<p>This is done by splitting the day into Easy and Hard activities.</p>

<ul>
<li>Easy: Morning Routine + Read Self-Improvement book. 2 pomos (Pomodoros).</li>
<li>Hard: Study/code JavaScript/React/work on front-end (hard, since learning a new language/framework): 4 pomos.</li>
<li>Easy: Eat lunch. (For the past few weeks, I&rsquo;ve been eating outside, but this week, I&rsquo;ve started cooking again. It&rsquo;s therapeutic.) 2 pomos.</li>
<li>Hard: Study/code back-end (Ruby/Elixir) programming. 4 pomos.</li>
<li>Exercise: Bike. 1-2 hours. I can watch videos while on the bike, so it&rsquo;s hard physically, but okay mentally.</li>
<li>Medium-Hard: Writing. 1-2 pomos.</li>
<li>Medium-Hard: Do a back-end task (programming something I know already, reading servers). 2 pomos.</li>
<li>Easy. Evening routine, write down how I improved in coding/writing/nutrition/fitness, and plan next day.</li>
</ul>

<p>I rinse and repeat most days. Sometimes I move the programming blocks around, but I generally try to get 10 pomos of programming each day. It&rsquo;s my primary objective, after all.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found that this structure really helps me guide how I get work done.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<ul>
<li>Because it&rsquo;s insanely hard to get all that in a day, I have to be very deliberate with things. Am I a workaholic? Potentially. Is it because I have lofty ambitions? Absolutely. I just want to make sure each days counts.</li>
<li>Because of the gamified nature of wanting to get perfect days, and because I was a big-time gamer, I&rsquo;m constantly paranoid of not putting in an empty day. &ldquo;Hey, have I done this?&rdquo;</li>
<li>In the middle of the Pomodoros, I can do mini-exercises. I do squats, pushups, core exercises. I also get time to do chores such as washing dishes and putting my clothes in the laundry.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tactics">Tactics</h2>

<ul>
<li>While I did Pomodoros before, it&rsquo;s only in 2018 that I decided to keep track of each Pomodoro by putting them into a computer program.

<ul>
<li>Keeping track of things via writing is extremely important. In 2014, when I was in a mad hunt to get a job, I logged every minute of coding practice, which resulted in me getting a job I wanted. In 2015 and 2016, I didn&rsquo;t diligently update that Excel document, and so I got into some bad habits at work. I was producing, but not really performing at my highest level.</li>
<li>When I got a project where I was the only back-end developer, I had higher accountability/work ownership. I created a program to help me log my productive hours. This program has been really helpful, and I was able to have a higher work performance again.</li>
<li>It comes to a point where you&rsquo;ll feel really bad when you put in a very low number on hours worked.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I use the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/marinara-pomodoro%C2%AE-assist/lojgmehidjdhhbmpjfamhpkpodfcodef?hl=en">Marinara Chrome extension</a> to start and stop the time. I can bind a keyboard shortcut to start or stop it (mine is Cmd-Shift-S).</li>
<li><a href="freedom.to">Freedom Blocklists</a> are key. When I&rsquo;m into those programming blocks, I activate the secondary blocklist, so essentially I&rsquo;m blocked from Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Twitter, Reddit, Youtube, Slack, and Hacker News. I think I have to take Slack out of that blocklist when I get a remote job.</li>
<li>Actually listing out what you&rsquo;ll be doing helps you prevent doing semi-productive things. For example, I can probably view the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)">history of Ruby</a>, which can be construed as productive, but it isn&rsquo;t the most optimal way of moving me towards my goals.</li>
<li>The evening routine is very important. You have to sort of force yourself to write down what you did that day. While I skipped this frequently at first, this was just me fooling myself because I knew that I didn&rsquo;t do crap that day. Writing things down really makes you honest.</li>
<li>Along with writing what happened, planning the next day also helps you offload tomorrow&rsquo;s mental processing/prioritizing to today. That&rsquo;s one less thing to worry about.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re burned out, then set aside blocks of time to play. I play basketball in the garage (honestly it&rsquo;s just dribbling and practicing some rebounding), take a walk, and watch stand-up comedy (Bill Burr!).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pitfalls">Pitfalls</h2>

<ul>
<li>It can become a time game. When you log time, are you really working? Well, it&rsquo;s a results thing. In the focus phase, were you able to get something of value done? Sometimes, I spend part of the rest phase writing down what I learned in the focus phase.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s okay to take off-days. You don&rsquo;t have to hit all the Pomos in a day. Just focus on getting better, one pomo at a time.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Still thinking about this part, but I know that everyone has a routine. It might be a crappy routine (wake up, play video games, go to sleep), but it&rsquo;s still a routine. I&rsquo;ve found that pomos really help me put times to things and increase my sense of urgency.</p>
