<div class="post-line"></div>

		

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been intermittent fasting over the last month or so, and the results have been dramatic: I&rsquo;ve lost 10 pounds in the last 6 weeks.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I&rsquo;m not a doctor, so try this at your own risk!</p>

<p>This is done without losing fitness as I can somehow bike faster, and I&rsquo;ve been doing some core exercises: I actually feel stronger, despite the weight loss!</p>

<p>My intermittent fasting schedule varies from day to day, but I try to keep my eating window within 6-8 hours: during most days, I start breaking my fast at 2-2:30pm, and eat my last meal at around 8-8:30 pm.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s highly impractical to eat 3 meals in that short time frame, so what usually happens is that I just eat 2 meals (lunch and dinner), which somehow saves me the time I spend to prepare and eat that third meal.</p>

<p>While it was absolutely brutal during the first few days, I had one powerful thought that keeps me going: <em>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t die.&rdquo;</em> (Just look it up online, but the world record for fasting is 382 days, so think about that the next time you tell yourself that you&rsquo;ll die if you don&rsquo;t get food.)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a great way of looking at the big picture: the only thing that&rsquo;s really standing between you and losing weight is the discomfort of hunger.</p>

<p>In order to get started with intermittent fasting, you&rsquo;ll need a great system to make sure that it&rsquo;s easy to follow the schedule: make it really hard to eat in the fasting window (in our case, we have very few food in the house at a given time), and make it really easy to eat in the eating window (I&rsquo;m not a foodie, so I just east the same few meals over and over).</p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;d say the past month&rsquo;s experiment has been a success-I think I&rsquo;ll be practicing intermittent fasting for the rest of my life!</p>
