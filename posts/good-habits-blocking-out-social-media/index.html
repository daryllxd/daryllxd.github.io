<p>Folks, this is about blocking out social media during the work day. You&rsquo;re free to use social media for whatever purposes you want in your free time! But if you&rsquo;re like me, who gets easily distracted, and sometimes doesn&rsquo;t do good work because of all the self-inflicted interruptions, I might have something for you.</p>

<p>For the past six or so weeks, I&rsquo;ve been hitting 50+ productive hours a week. I&rsquo;ve coded a ton, learned a new programming language, read 5++ books, published 5++ blog posts, biked 20++ times and more than 1000 kilometers, and created my speech for an upcoming work conference.</p>

<p><img src="/img/2018-good-habits-blocking-social-media-github.png" style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto;"/></p>

<p><em>A screenshot from the developer social network, Github. Each green box represents a day. A deeper shade of green means I pushed more commits that day.</em> <a href="https://github.com/daryllxd">My Github profile.</a></p>

<p>Over the next few weeks, I&rsquo;ll be posting about the techniques/habits I use to (hopefully) be more productive. And no, I do not feel burned-out in any way. In fact, I haven&rsquo;t felt this excited about programming in the last few months. I&rsquo;m really excited to show other people the things I&rsquo;ve been building.</p>

<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ll describe my social media blocking techniques.</p>

<h2 id="technique-1-system-wide-block">Technique 1: System-Wide Block</h2>

<p><img src="/img/2018-good-habits-blocking-social-media-blocked.gif" style="width: 300px; height: 300px; margin: 0 auto;"/></p>

<p>So I just have one computer. Being a programmer (and hopefully writer), this is the place I have to be productive in. I have to treat this as a workstation where for as long as possible, I can only do work-related things here.</p>

<p>I use this Mac-based app called <a href="https://freedom.to/">Freedom</a> to block Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and Pinterest. From 12am to 11pm, I only see a blank screen when I go those sites.</p>

<p>At first, I thought it was insane and masochistic. There was big fear of missing out. But after a few days, my brain reprogrammed itself. Now, I no longer had the &ldquo;Open in New Tab, F, Enter&rdquo; habit.</p>

<p>You might be thinking, &ldquo;What a weirdo. Why does he have to block his entire system? Why doesn&rsquo;t he just not visit those sites?&rdquo; Well, we only have a finite amount of brain power and will power per day. I&rsquo;d rather spend it creating things as opposed to randomly browsing other people&rsquo;s lives.</p>

<p>I prefer to let software help me concentrate, rather than let software distract me from my life&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the same principle with resisting video games. When I was at Sourcepad, my co-workers thought I was crazy for constantly uninstalling and reinstalling Dota on an almost daily basis. My hard drive might have been damaged, but at least I wasn&rsquo;t getting sucked in playing 5 hours a day as an adult.</p>

<p>You know, I&rsquo;m actually considering making that system-wide block last for the whole day. I can still be reached on phone anyway. Which brings me to my next point…</p>

<h2 id="technique-2-unfollowing-everyone-removing-the-news-feed">Technique 2: Unfollowing Everyone/Removing the News Feed</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no Freedom app for Android just yet. So I can&rsquo;t apply the same blocking techniques there. I can soft-block myself by putting the phone in an inaccessible place (in my case, it&rsquo;s in the attic, so I have to literally go up a ladder to get my phone), but if I have to pick up the phone and use it, there&rsquo;s still a chance I get to scrolling hell on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

<p><strong>The best solution I have for the phone (asides from uninstalling both apps) is to just unfollow everyone.</strong> And boom. No more News Feed. No more posts to endlessly scroll.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a Facebook friend, please don&rsquo;t take this the wrong way. In my free time, I still visit people&rsquo;s posts. I&rsquo;m still interested in your lives. It&rsquo;s just that I prefer actually going to your profiles and checking out what&rsquo;s up rather than being bombarded with all the status updates.</p>

<h2 id="technique-3-selective-block-for-semi-productive-social-media">Technique 3: Selective Block for Semi-&ldquo;Productive&rdquo; Social Media</h2>

<p>I also use a separate blocklist for Twitter, Email, Hacker News, Youtube, and Reddit. I usually turn these on for 1-3 hours at a time, before starting a chunk of programming or writing time.</p>

<p>These websites fall under the category of &ldquo;productive maybe&rdquo;—I can&rsquo;t deny that I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from the programming subreddits, motivational videos on Youtube, and articles on Hacker News—but when I get into really productive work, I need to keep those sites out. Because of their semi-productive nature, I can spend hours in them, think I got something done because I&rsquo;m learning something, but not really have anything to show for at the end of the day. It&rsquo;s just a bad place to be in.</p>

<h2 id="overkill">Overkill?</h2>

<p>I think programming is in a special class of profession where I can honestly say that the Internet is truly mandatory. I can theoretically write without Internet, I&rsquo;m doing so right now. Even a designer, after they have mastered a substantial part of their craft, doesn&rsquo;t need to Google as often as a programmer does.</p>

<p>Imagine working in a library and every time you needed to borrow a book, there&rsquo;s a slot machine beside it. And it&rsquo;s free. And you might learn things.</p>

<p>Oops, I have to ship this blog post out. I&rsquo;ll come back to this in the future. See you!</p>

<h2 id="techniques-over-the-next-weeks">Techniques over the next weeks:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Setting aside exact blocks of time using any technique you know.</li>
<li>Being self-aware of yourself.</li>
<li>Front-loading hard things, having breaks in between, and removing as much decision making as possible.</li>
<li>Calling out your bullshit or &ldquo;justifications&rdquo; or rationalizations on not being productive.</li>
</ul>
