		<p>There are days where I can say that I&rsquo;m really not that motivated that much. It could be something with my brain or with my sleep or with my food or with my exercise, but I don&rsquo;t want anyone reading this blog to have this illusion that I don&rsquo;t have bad days. I&rsquo;ve had a lot of shitty days.</p>

<p>When those days come along, I ask myself, what is the smallest unit of work that I can do to move me closer to my dreams?</p>

<p>I would really not program today, but I can probably read on 100 word blog post on programming. Hell, I don&rsquo;t even have to open my programming editor.</p>

<p>I would really rather not write today, but I can probably read 1 paragraph on this writing book that I got from the Internet.</p>

<p>I would really not exercise today, but I can probably just walk 1 kilometer just to say that I exercised for the day.</p>

<p>Try not to have a zero day, try to have a &ldquo;one percent better&rdquo; day, or even a &ldquo;0.01 percent better&rdquo; day. You&rsquo;ll be surprised at how the small one percents add up.</p>
