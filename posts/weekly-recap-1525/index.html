<h2 id="life-updates">Life updates:</h2>

<p>So I&rsquo;ve been unemployed as of the end of November last year. I&rsquo;ve done some things since then (travelling, hiking, getting the flu) but I&rsquo;ve primarily been in hermit mode for the last weeks.</p>

<p>Every day has been the same: Wake up in the afternoon. Write things in my journal. Read personal development books. Read programming books.. Listen to podcasts. Practice my atrocious writing. Bike indoors for my exercise (though I still skip some sessions ðŸ˜ž). Occasionally, coo.  Watch Boston Celtics highlights. Code. Repeat.</p>

<p>When things get too monotonous, I go out and go to a coffee shop to see actual people. But for the most part my days are the same as when I was an employee. I think it&rsquo;s actually more intense, since I don&rsquo;t have my homies (project managers, other developers) as support. So I am accountable for my own actions.</p>

<p>Being accountable means I can&rsquo;t really waste days. But I enjoy the process. I enjoy trying to squeeze out every productive moment I can.</p>

<p>Why am I doing this? Well, in order for me to get a decent next job (which I hope will be overseas), I need to work my ass off. I need to know all the algorithms asked in interviews. I need to know all parts of the web stack, even if I haven&rsquo;t touched the front-end in a year. I need to get better at interacting with people so the interviewer will like me.  Basically, I need to show to a future employer that I have such-and-such skills, so it would be</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not as bad as it sounds. Before I got to Sourcepad, I was at full-on hermit mode for my last college semester. I was just telling myself, I need to outwork every guy who wants MY Ruby job. I wanted to make sure that I did everything I could to get a job I want. And I got one at Sourcepad! Now, after 3 and a half years, I&rsquo;m doing it over again. And honestly, I&rsquo;m enjoying the whole process.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve given myself a deadline of March 7-8 for this. Let&rsquo;s see what happens then.</p>
