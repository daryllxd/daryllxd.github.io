## Skills and Self-Study

- Over the past months since my departure from Sourcepad, I have been studying and applying myself to:
  - Public speaking: I spoke at the last [Rubyconf Philippines](http://rubyconf.ph/2018/) about habits I've accumulated as I got better through the years. I've also spoked at the Philippine Ruby User Group meetups multiple times.
  - Writing. I blog frequently at my website, [Daryll Codes (https://daryll.codes)](https://daryll.codes).
  - ReactJS. I'm creating a micro-site [(https://writing.daryll.codes)](http://writing.daryll.codes/) that allows people to select a writing prompt for journaling. After I finish this, I'll continue creating micro-sites to master React and Redux.
  - Elixir/Phoenix. My project for Elixir is [an app](https://github.com/daryllxd/habits_two) that helps me keep track of my habits per day.
  - Deployment via Chef and AWS.
- [My Github repo on lifelong learning has more than 100,000 lines of notes on software development.](http://github.com/daryllxd/lifelong-learning)
- I write about my daily learnings (nearing 250 entries) in software development here: [Today I Learned](https://til.daryll.codes).
- [I've read close to 100 books: some on programming, some on personal development.](https://daryll.codes/books/)
- [I've finished 25+ Coursera courses.](https://www.coursera.org/user/9fe1688231eedc03a30f665e59d753e9)
- I am a very hardworking individual who isn't afraid to get out of the comfort zone. My hobbies include long-distance cycling (I cycle 200km a week) and hiking (25+ mountains scaled).
