      <description>On the 1536th week of my life, I:
 Read: Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder, by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. Reading: Reinventing Remittances with Bitcoin, by Luis Buenaventura. Reading: The Obstacle is the Way. Wrote: 3 daily articles. Programming  Kafka Writing Books system. Refactoring Writing Prompts.   Antifragile I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I enjoyed Antifragile. While there are certainly a lot of good ideas in there, I don&amp;rsquo;t get why he writes in such a verbose and unintelligible way.</description>

      <title>30 Days of Writing, Day 15: How I Learn Programming Languages and Technologies</title>

      <description>Over the past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot of different programming languages and web development techniques: ReactJS/&amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; JavaScript, Redis, Domain-Driven Design, Elixir/Phoenix, and AWS/Chef/Docker. While I&amp;rsquo;m still at various levels from newbie to intermediate, I think I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten a better grasp of how to learn new technologies now. Here&amp;rsquo;s how I did it:
 Devote a few hours reading about the possible use case of that technology. For 2018, my goal was to expand to full-stack status (front-end framework to Rails to servers).</description>

      <title>30 Days of Writing, Day 14: Ideas From Antifragile</title>

      <guid>https://daryll.codes/posts/30-days-of-writing-day-14-ideas-from-antifragile/</guid>
      <description>Antifragile by Nassim Nicolas Taleb was really difficult to read: I can deal with his incessant ranting, but he really loves using complicated words and long paragraphs. Here are some things I took away from this book.
On fragility: while fragile objects like porcelain cups break apart when shocked or stressed, antifragile concepts benefit from those. This probably confirms what I think about re: investing time and money on online courses, books, and studying over clothes and luxury goods, because knowledge stays with you, as long as you apply it, and material possessions can get lost, destroyed, or stolen.</description>

      <description>When things don&amp;rsquo;t go our way, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to rationalize by thinking of every single excuse: &amp;ldquo;I was tired that day&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to work for that company anyway&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;The system is against me&amp;rdquo;.
When I was transferring colleges after flunking out of engineering, the Tourism college secretary didn&amp;rsquo;t accept my transfer request because of a low GPA.
For your information Mr. Secretary, this &amp;ldquo;low&amp;rdquo; GPA was because of my (irrelevant to your course) engineering classes heavily skewed that number!</description>

      <description>Get the money. Get the money, and then let’s get around a table, and let’s create new rules.
It is going to be made, it is going to be allocated, and you have a moral imperative to make sure that if you have a point of view that matters, and you want to reflect it, you get it.
It will be about a competition of views. Money drives the world, for better or for worse.</description>

      <description>The story doesn&amp;rsquo;t end until you choose for it to end. I learned this story the hard way when I was still trying to develop my mind and my mental toughness.
In order for me to become a UP mountaineer, I needed to run 15 kilometers in 1 hour and 45 minutes.
Because of my lack of preparation, both physically and mentally, I struggled mightily, and at one point, I yelled out in frustration to my friends who were helping me, &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t know how I feel!</description>

      <title>30 Days of Writing,Day 10: On Intermittent Fasting</title>
      <link>https://daryll.codes/posts/30-days-of-writing-day-10-on-intermittent-fasting/</link>

      <guid>https://daryll.codes/posts/30-days-of-writing-day-10-on-intermittent-fasting/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been intermittent fasting over the last month or so, and the results have been dramatic: I&amp;rsquo;ve lost 10 pounds in the last 6 weeks.
Disclaimer: I&amp;rsquo;m not a doctor, so try this at your own risk!
This is done without losing fitness as I can somehow bike faster, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some core exercises: I actually feel stronger, despite the weight loss!
My intermittent fasting schedule varies from day to day, but I try to keep my eating window within 6-8 hours: during most days, I start breaking my fast at 2-2:30pm, and eat my last meal at around 8-8:30 pm.</description>

      <description>Unfortunately, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to write this blog post on time, as I slept before pushing this article out. I could rationalize and say that I was too tired, but I had an entire day (and to be quite honest, I only really need less than an hour) to do this, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t.
And that&amp;rsquo;s okay. You can&amp;rsquo;t expect every day to go the way you want to. What&amp;rsquo;s important is you pick yourself back up and try again the next day.</description>

      <title>30 Days of Writing: Day 8, An Inhuman Climb</title>

      <description>Today, I rode a climb up Tagaytay, Sungay In the Philippines. It&amp;rsquo;s an inhuman climb, with gradients at 15% in the straighter sections and up to 25% in the corners. It&amp;rsquo;s a climb that is difficult to walk on, never mind riding a bike though.
It&amp;rsquo;s often at the edge of our ability that every thing we put in matters. While I&amp;rsquo;ve been religiously training on the bike for the past few months, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a road bike for two years, the Sungay climb&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous gradients exposed me.</description>

      <description>There are days where I can say that I&amp;rsquo;m really not that motivated that much. It could be something with my brain or with my sleep or with my food or with my exercise, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want anyone reading this blog to have this illusion that I don&amp;rsquo;t have bad days. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of shitty days.
When those days come along, I ask myself, what is the smallest unit of work that I can do to move me closer to my dreams?</description>

      <description>You choose the suffering you want to experience. &amp;ldquo;Suffer the pain of discipline or suffer the pain of regret.&amp;rdquo;
As I struggle (and groan at the words that I&amp;rsquo;m typing) to think and push through with this article, I know that at any time, I can just switch to a new tab and continue mindlessly browsing Twitter and Hacker News.
The problem with doing that is that I know that I&amp;rsquo;ll hate myself in the morning when the feeling of having skipped a day clouds over me, and I&amp;rsquo;d rather just kludge through writing this post even if I&amp;rsquo;m really sleepy and tired.</description>

      <description>This title is very apt since I&amp;rsquo;m really tired right now (the bike just killed me), but here goes.
You brain has a limited amount of willpower and decisions it can do per day. Don&amp;rsquo;t waste this on stupid shit by creating systems that will incentivize good habits while disallowing bad ones.
Food system: there&amp;rsquo;s no way for my brother and I to eat bad food in the house because we only buy nutritious food.</description>

      <description>A huge life goal of mine is to create a body of work that I can ultimately look back on and be proud of. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to build some software that helps a lot of people, or write a blog post that gets someone to take control of their life, or possibly speak at a conference and inspire someone to build their own empire.
If that is to be a reality, then I&amp;rsquo;ll have to put in a certain number of repetitive deliberate practice.</description>

      <title>30 Days of Writing, Day 3: Always try to do things faster.</title>

      <guid>https://daryll.codes/posts/30-days-of-writing-day-3-always-try-to-do-things-faster/</guid>
      <description>Always ask yourself: is there an easier, faster, and better way of doing things?
If there is, then follow up by asking, would the time spent learning that way save time in the long-term?
I first came into contact with the text editor I use for writing my programs (Vim) 4 years ago, and while it was a nightmare to learn I knew that if I just buckled down and forced myself to learn it for the next 20-100 hours, it would pay off at some point.</description>

      <description>In my junior and senior years in college, I had absolutely nothing going for me (horrible grades, very few friends, and no money) that I based my self-worth off my greatest &amp;ldquo;strength&amp;rdquo; at the time, which was video games and Magic: The Gathering.
A really low point was when I was trying to construct a resume to look for a call center job after I had been expelled from my college—asides from the schools I attended, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t write anything.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s something seriously wrong with how I interpret myself as an aspiring writer. For someone who has the audacity to call himself that, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been doing a lot of writing.
My long-standing alibi has been &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll write the horribleness out of my system by just writing a lot of articles&amp;rdquo;, but I seem to always conveniently forget what &amp;ldquo;a lot&amp;rdquo; means, especially when it comes to hitting &amp;ldquo;commit&amp;rdquo; on my computer.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone. Let me share a productivity tip that I&amp;rsquo;ve been using for years. It&amp;rsquo;s called the Pomodoro technique. The one sentence summary is that you work in blocks of 25 minutes at a time, resting for five minutes in between. After every four Pomodoros, you can take a longer break (typically 15-20 minutes).
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using this technique since I started actually programming professionally. It&amp;rsquo;s really helped me over the last 5 years.</description>

      <description>Folks, this is about blocking out social media during the work day. You&amp;rsquo;re free to use social media for whatever purposes you want in your free time! But if you&amp;rsquo;re like me, who gets easily distracted, and sometimes doesn&amp;rsquo;t do good work because of all the self-inflicted interruptions, I might have something for you.
For the past six or so weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve been hitting 50+ productive hours a week. I&amp;rsquo;ve coded a ton, learned a new programming language, read 5++ books, published 5++ blog posts, biked 20++ times and more than 1000 kilometers, and created my speech for an upcoming work conference.</description>

      <title>Good Habits: The 100 Things Challenge</title>
      <link>https://daryll.codes/posts/good-habits-decluttering/</link>

      <description>Summary:
 I have 103 things. Having few, high quality things has made my life easier because I don&amp;rsquo;t have to think that much. The point of the challenge is not having a limit, but limiting consumption. Impulse buys are the worst. Whenever you want to buy something, don&amp;rsquo;t think you&amp;rsquo;ll miss out if you don&amp;rsquo;t buy it. Just wait for a few days before actually buying the thing.  I first heard about the 100 Things Challenge when I was a college student.</description>

      <title>Travel Guide: Korea in Winter</title>

      <description>Getting the Visa (Philippines): Visa requirements are on the Korean embassy page.
If your parents are retired (they don&amp;rsquo;t have an ITR), you can use your ITR as a substitute. My brother is in school so I used my ITR since I was sponsoring his trip.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think you need to be physically present when applying for the Visa. We forgot a requirement (my brother&amp;rsquo;s school certificate) the first time we got there so we re-applied a few days after.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start blogging again. And this time I want to stick to this for good (like for the rest of my life). A few years back I did the Project 365 thing where you took a picture of the day for 365 days. I really liked that year since I actively tried to do something per day so surely writing about things should have that kind of effect 😱</description>
