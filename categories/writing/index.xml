      <description>Draft  Over the past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve been eating the same few nutritious meals. I&amp;rsquo;m very lucky to live near a store that sells salads for $2. As such I can live most days getting my vegetables.
There are some days where I deviate from the norm, though. At some point in the day I break down and buy a bag of chips. I consume and binge those chips.</description>

      <title>30 Days of Writing Day 16 Focus on the Message, Not the Messenger</title>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ll meet several thousands of people in your life, and they have their own viewpoints and stories and whatever, and you&amp;rsquo;ll disagree with them a fair amount of times given a life time, but you should always remembers one thing: they&amp;rsquo;re not always wrong, and you&amp;rsquo;re not always right.
You have to fight the innate human instinct to short-circuit decision making which incentivizes making a snap judgment on an idea based on its messenger.</description>

      <title>30 Days of Writing, Day 15: How I Learn Programming Languages and Technologies</title>

      <description>Over the past few months I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot of different programming languages and web development techniques: ReactJS/&amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; JavaScript, Redis, Domain-Driven Design, Elixir/Phoenix, and AWS/Chef/Docker. While I&amp;rsquo;m still at various levels from newbie to intermediate, I think I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten a better grasp of how to learn new technologies now. Here&amp;rsquo;s how I did it:
 Devote a few hours reading about the possible use case of that technology. For 2018, my goal was to expand to full-stack status (front-end framework to Rails to servers).</description>

      <title>30 Days of Writing, Day 14: Ideas From Antifragile</title>

      <guid>https://daryll.codes/posts/30-days-of-writing-day-14-ideas-from-antifragile/</guid>
      <description>Antifragile by Nassim Nicolas Taleb was really difficult to read: I can deal with his incessant ranting, but he really loves using complicated words and long paragraphs. Here are some things I took away from this book.
On fragility: while fragile objects like porcelain cups break apart when shocked or stressed, antifragile concepts benefit from those. This probably confirms what I think about re: investing time and money on online courses, books, and studying over clothes and luxury goods, because knowledge stays with you, as long as you apply it, and material possessions can get lost, destroyed, or stolen.</description>

      <title>30 Days of Writing, Day 13: Stop Complaining</title>

      <description>When things don&amp;rsquo;t go our way, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to rationalize by thinking of every single excuse: &amp;ldquo;I was tired that day&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to work for that company anyway&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;The system is against me&amp;rdquo;.
When I was transferring colleges after flunking out of engineering, the Tourism college secretary didn&amp;rsquo;t accept my transfer request because of a low GPA.
For your information Mr. Secretary, this &amp;ldquo;low&amp;rdquo; GPA was because of my (irrelevant to your course) engineering classes heavily skewed that number!</description>

      <title>30 Days of Writing, Day 12: Chamath and &#39;Money as an Instrument of Change&#39;</title>

      <description>Get the money. Get the money, and then let’s get around a table, and let’s create new rules.
It is going to be made, it is going to be allocated, and you have a moral imperative to make sure that if you have a point of view that matters, and you want to reflect it, you get it.
It will be about a competition of views. Money drives the world, for better or for worse.</description>

      <title>30 Days of Writing, Day 11: You Choose How the Story Ends</title>

      <description>The story doesn&amp;rsquo;t end until you choose for it to end. I learned this story the hard way when I was still trying to develop my mind and my mental toughness.
In order for me to become a UP mountaineer, I needed to run 15 kilometers in 1 hour and 45 minutes.
Because of my lack of preparation, both physically and mentally, I struggled mightily, and at one point, I yelled out in frustration to my friends who were helping me, &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t know how I feel!</description>

      <title>30 Days of Writing,Day 10: On Intermittent Fasting</title>
      <link>https://daryll.codes/posts/30-days-of-writing-day-10-on-intermittent-fasting/</link>

      <guid>https://daryll.codes/posts/30-days-of-writing-day-10-on-intermittent-fasting/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been intermittent fasting over the last month or so, and the results have been dramatic: I&amp;rsquo;ve lost 10 pounds in the last 6 weeks.
Disclaimer: I&amp;rsquo;m not a doctor, so try this at your own risk!
This is done without losing fitness as I can somehow bike faster, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some core exercises: I actually feel stronger, despite the weight loss!
My intermittent fasting schedule varies from day to day, but I try to keep my eating window within 6-8 hours: during most days, I start breaking my fast at 2-2:30pm, and eat my last meal at around 8-8:30 pm.</description>

      <title>30 Days of Writing, Day 9: You Can Make Mistakes</title>

      <description>Unfortunately, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to write this blog post on time, as I slept before pushing this article out. I could rationalize and say that I was too tired, but I had an entire day (and to be quite honest, I only really need less than an hour) to do this, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t.
And that&amp;rsquo;s okay. You can&amp;rsquo;t expect every day to go the way you want to. What&amp;rsquo;s important is you pick yourself back up and try again the next day.</description>

      <title>30 Days of Writing: Day 8, An Inhuman Climb</title>

      <description>Today, I rode a climb up Tagaytay, Sungay In the Philippines. It&amp;rsquo;s an inhuman climb, with gradients at 15% in the straighter sections and up to 25% in the corners. It&amp;rsquo;s a climb that is difficult to walk on, never mind riding a bike though.
It&amp;rsquo;s often at the edge of our ability that every thing we put in matters. While I&amp;rsquo;ve been religiously training on the bike for the past few months, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a road bike for two years, the Sungay climb&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous gradients exposed me.</description>

      <title>30 Days of Writing, Day 7: Just Have a One Percent Day</title>

      <description>There are days where I can say that I&amp;rsquo;m really not that motivated that much. It could be something with my brain or with my sleep or with my food or with my exercise, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want anyone reading this blog to have this illusion that I don&amp;rsquo;t have bad days. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of shitty days.
When those days come along, I ask myself, what is the smallest unit of work that I can do to move me closer to my dreams?</description>

      <title>30 Days of Writing, Day 6: Don&#39;t Do Things You Know You&#39;ll Regret</title>

      <description>You choose the suffering you want to experience. &amp;ldquo;Suffer the pain of discipline or suffer the pain of regret.&amp;rdquo;
As I struggle (and groan at the words that I&amp;rsquo;m typing) to think and push through with this article, I know that at any time, I can just switch to a new tab and continue mindlessly browsing Twitter and Hacker News.
The problem with doing that is that I know that I&amp;rsquo;ll hate myself in the morning when the feeling of having skipped a day clouds over me, and I&amp;rsquo;d rather just kludge through writing this post even if I&amp;rsquo;m really sleepy and tired.</description>

      <title>30 Days of Writing, Day 5: Systems Instead of Discipline.</title>

      <description>This title is very apt since I&amp;rsquo;m really tired right now (the bike just killed me), but here goes.
You brain has a limited amount of willpower and decisions it can do per day. Don&amp;rsquo;t waste this on stupid shit by creating systems that will incentivize good habits while disallowing bad ones.
Food system: there&amp;rsquo;s no way for my brother and I to eat bad food in the house because we only buy nutritious food.</description>

      <description>A huge life goal of mine is to create a body of work that I can ultimately look back on and be proud of. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to build some software that helps a lot of people, or write a blog post that gets someone to take control of their life, or possibly speak at a conference and inspire someone to build their own empire.
If that is to be a reality, then I&amp;rsquo;ll have to put in a certain number of repetitive deliberate practice.</description>

      <title>30 Days of Writing, Day 3: Always try to do things faster.</title>

      <description>Always ask yourself: is there an easier, faster, and better way of doing things?
If there is, then follow up by asking, would the time spent learning that way save time in the long-term?
I first came into contact with the text editor I use for writing my programs (Vim) 4 years ago, and while it was a nightmare to learn I knew that if I just buckled down and forced myself to learn it for the next 20-100 hours, it would pay off at some point.</description>

      <title>30 Days of Writing, day 2: Base your self-worth on learning.</title>

      <description>In my junior and senior years in college, I had absolutely nothing going for me (horrible grades, very few friends, and no money) that I based my self-worth off my greatest &amp;ldquo;strength&amp;rdquo; at the time, which was video games and Magic: The Gathering.
A really low point was when I was trying to construct a resume to look for a call center job after I had been expelled from my college—asides from the schools I attended, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t write anything.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s something seriously wrong with how I interpret myself as an aspiring writer. For someone who has the audacity to call himself that, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been doing a lot of writing.
My long-standing alibi has been &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll write the horribleness out of my system by just writing a lot of articles&amp;rdquo;, but I seem to always conveniently forget what &amp;ldquo;a lot&amp;rdquo; means, especially when it comes to hitting &amp;ldquo;commit&amp;rdquo; on my computer.</description>
