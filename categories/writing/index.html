        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Draft  Over the past few months I&rsquo;ve been eating the same few nutritious meals. I&rsquo;m very lucky to live near a store that sells salads for $2. As such I can live most days getting my vegetables.
There are some days where I deviate from the norm, though. At some point in the day I break down and buy a bag of chips. I consume and binge those chips.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            You&rsquo;ll meet several thousands of people in your life, and they have their own viewpoints and stories and whatever, and you&rsquo;ll disagree with them a fair amount of times given a life time, but you should always remembers one thing: they&rsquo;re not always wrong, and you&rsquo;re not always right.
You have to fight the innate human instinct to short-circuit decision making which incentivizes making a snap judgment on an idea based on its messenger.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Over the past few months I&rsquo;ve learned a lot of different programming languages and web development techniques: ReactJS/&ldquo;modern&rdquo; JavaScript, Redis, Domain-Driven Design, Elixir/Phoenix, and AWS/Chef/Docker. While I&rsquo;m still at various levels from newbie to intermediate, I think I&rsquo;ve gotten a better grasp of how to learn new technologies now. Here&rsquo;s how I did it:
 Devote a few hours reading about the possible use case of that technology. For 2018, my goal was to expand to full-stack status (front-end framework to Rails to servers).

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Antifragile by Nassim Nicolas Taleb was really difficult to read: I can deal with his incessant ranting, but he really loves using complicated words and long paragraphs. Here are some things I took away from this book.
On fragility: while fragile objects like porcelain cups break apart when shocked or stressed, antifragile concepts benefit from those. This probably confirms what I think about re: investing time and money on online courses, books, and studying over clothes and luxury goods, because knowledge stays with you, as long as you apply it, and material possessions can get lost, destroyed, or stolen.

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">30 Days of Writing, Day 13: Stop Complaining</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            When things don&rsquo;t go our way, it&rsquo;s easy to rationalize by thinking of every single excuse: &ldquo;I was tired that day&rdquo;, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to work for that company anyway&rdquo;, &ldquo;The system is against me&rdquo;.
When I was transferring colleges after flunking out of engineering, the Tourism college secretary didn&rsquo;t accept my transfer request because of a low GPA.
For your information Mr. Secretary, this &ldquo;low&rdquo; GPA was because of my (irrelevant to your course) engineering classes heavily skewed that number!

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Get the money. Get the money, and then let’s get around a table, and let’s create new rules.
It is going to be made, it is going to be allocated, and you have a moral imperative to make sure that if you have a point of view that matters, and you want to reflect it, you get it.
It will be about a competition of views. Money drives the world, for better or for worse.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            The story doesn&rsquo;t end until you choose for it to end. I learned this story the hard way when I was still trying to develop my mind and my mental toughness.
In order for me to become a UP mountaineer, I needed to run 15 kilometers in 1 hour and 45 minutes.
Because of my lack of preparation, both physically and mentally, I struggled mightily, and at one point, I yelled out in frustration to my friends who were helping me, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how I feel!

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">30 Days of Writing,Day 10: On Intermittent Fasting</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            I&rsquo;ve been intermittent fasting over the last month or so, and the results have been dramatic: I&rsquo;ve lost 10 pounds in the last 6 weeks.
Disclaimer: I&rsquo;m not a doctor, so try this at your own risk!
This is done without losing fitness as I can somehow bike faster, and I&rsquo;ve been doing some core exercises: I actually feel stronger, despite the weight loss!
My intermittent fasting schedule varies from day to day, but I try to keep my eating window within 6-8 hours: during most days, I start breaking my fast at 2-2:30pm, and eat my last meal at around 8-8:30 pm.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Unfortunately, I wasn&rsquo;t able to write this blog post on time, as I slept before pushing this article out. I could rationalize and say that I was too tired, but I had an entire day (and to be quite honest, I only really need less than an hour) to do this, and I didn&rsquo;t.
And that&rsquo;s okay. You can&rsquo;t expect every day to go the way you want to. What&rsquo;s important is you pick yourself back up and try again the next day.

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">30 Days of Writing: Day 8, An Inhuman Climb</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Today, I rode a climb up Tagaytay, Sungay In the Philippines. It&rsquo;s an inhuman climb, with gradients at 15% in the straighter sections and up to 25% in the corners. It&rsquo;s a climb that is difficult to walk on, never mind riding a bike though.
It&rsquo;s often at the edge of our ability that every thing we put in matters. While I&rsquo;ve been religiously training on the bike for the past few months, and I&rsquo;ve been using a road bike for two years, the Sungay climb&rsquo;s ridiculous gradients exposed me.
