      <description>Folks, this is about blocking out social media during the work day. You&amp;rsquo;re free to use social media for whatever purposes you want in your free time! But if you&amp;rsquo;re like me, who gets easily distracted, and sometimes doesn&amp;rsquo;t do good work because of all the self-inflicted interruptions, I might have something for you.
For the past six or so weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve been hitting 50+ productive hours a week. I&amp;rsquo;ve coded a ton, learned a new programming language, read 5++ books, published 5++ blog posts, biked 20++ times and more than 1000 kilometers, and created my speech for an upcoming work conference.</description>

      <title>Good Habits: The 100 Things Challenge</title>

      <description>Summary:
 I have 103 things. Having few, high quality things has made my life easier because I don&amp;rsquo;t have to think that much. The point of the challenge is not having a limit, but limiting consumption. Impulse buys are the worst. Whenever you want to buy something, don&amp;rsquo;t think you&amp;rsquo;ll miss out if you don&amp;rsquo;t buy it. Just wait for a few days before actually buying the thing.  I first heard about the 100 Things Challenge when I was a college student.</description>
