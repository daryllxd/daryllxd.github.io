      <description>Summary:
 I have 103 things. Having few, high quality things has made my life easier because I don&amp;rsquo;t have to think that much. The point of the challenge is not having a limit, but limiting consumption. Impulse buys are the worst. Whenever you want to buy something, don&amp;rsquo;t think you&amp;rsquo;ll miss out if you don&amp;rsquo;t buy it. Just wait for a few days before actually buying the thing.  I first heard about the 100 Things Challenge when I was a college student.</description>
