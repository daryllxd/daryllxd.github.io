      <description>Always ask yourself: is there an easier, faster, and better way of doing things?
If there is, then follow up by asking, would the time spent learning that way save time in the long-term?
I first came into contact with the text editor I use for writing my programs (Vim) 4 years ago, and while it was a nightmare to learn I knew that if I just buckled down and forced myself to learn it for the next 20-100 hours, it would pay off at some point.</description>

      <description>In my junior and senior years in college, I had absolutely nothing going for me (horrible grades, very few friends, and no money) that I based my self-worth off my greatest &amp;ldquo;strength&amp;rdquo; at the time, which was video games and Magic: The Gathering.
A really low point was when I was trying to construct a resume to look for a call center job after I had been expelled from my collegeâ€”asides from the schools I attended, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t write anything.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s something seriously wrong with how I interpret myself as an aspiring writer. For someone who has the audacity to call himself that, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been doing a lot of writing.
My long-standing alibi has been &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll write the horribleness out of my system by just writing a lot of articles&amp;rdquo;, but I seem to always conveniently forget what &amp;ldquo;a lot&amp;rdquo; means, especially when it comes to hitting &amp;ldquo;commit&amp;rdquo; on my computer.</description>
